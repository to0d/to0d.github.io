<p>
	The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on &ldquo;inside&rdquo; another program while it executes&mdash;or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.
</p>
<p>
	GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
</p>
<pre><code>- Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
- Make your program stop on specified conditions.
- Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
- Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.</code></pre>
<p>
	You can use GDB to debug programs written in C and C++. For more information, see Supported Languages. For more information, see C and C++.
</p>
<p>
	Support for D is partial. For information on D, see D.
</p>
<p>
	Support for Modula&ndash;2 is partial. For information on Modula&ndash;2, see Modula&ndash;2.
</p>
<p>
	Support for OpenCL C is partial. For information on OpenCL C, see OpenCL C.
</p>
<p>
	Debugging Pascal programs which use sets, subranges, file variables, or nested functions does not currently work. GDB does not support entering expressions, printing values, or similar features using Pascal syntax.
</p>
<p>
	GDB can be used to debug programs written in Fortran, although it may be necessary to refer to some variables with a trailing underscore.
</p>
<p>
	GDB can be used to debug programs written in Objective&ndash;C, using either the Apple/NeXT or the GNU Objective&ndash;C runtime.
</p>
	<H1><a name="HEAD_1698b1d3" href="#TOC_HEAD_1698b1d3">1 A Sample GDB Session</a></H1>
<p>
	You can use this manual at your leisure to read all about GDB. However, a handful of commands are enough to get started using the debugger. This chapter illustrates those commands.
</p>
<p>
	One of the preliminary versions of GNU m4 (a generic macro processor) exhibits the following bug: sometimes, when we change its quote strings from the default, the commands used to capture one macro definition within another stop working. In the following short m4 session, we define a macro foo which expands to 0000; we then use the m4 built&ndash;in defn to define bar as the same thing. However, when we change the open quote string to &lt;QUOTE&gt; and the close quote string to &lt;UNQUOTE&gt;, the same procedure fails to define a new synonym baz:
</p>
<pre><code>$ cd gnu/m4
$ ./m4
define(foo,0000)

foo
0000
define(bar,defn(‘foo’))

bar
0000
changequote(&lt;QUOTE&gt;,&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;)

define(baz,defn(&lt;QUOTE&gt;foo&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;))
baz
Ctrl-d
m4: End of input: 0: fatal error: EOF in string</code></pre>
<p>
	Let us use GDB to try to see what is going on.
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb m4
GDB is free software and you are welcome to distribute copies
of it under certain conditions; type "show copying" to see
the conditions.
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB; type "show warranty"
for details.

GDB 14.0.50.20230605-git, Copyright 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc...
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB reads only enough symbol data to know where to find the rest when needed; as a result, the first prompt comes up very quickly. We now tell GDB to use a narrower display width than usual, so that examples fit in this manual.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set width 70</code></pre>
<p>
	We need to see how the m4 built&ndash;in changequote works. Having looked at the source, we know the relevant subroutine is m4_changequote, so we set a breakpoint there with the GDB break command.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) break m4_changequote
Breakpoint 1 at 0x62f4: file builtin.c, line 879.</code></pre>
<p>
	Using the run command, we start m4 running under GDB control; as long as control does not reach the m4_changequote subroutine, the program runs as usual:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) run
Starting program: /work/Editorial/gdb/gnu/m4/m4
define(foo,0000)

foo
0000</code></pre>
<p>
	To trigger the breakpoint, we call changequote. GDB suspends execution of m4, displaying information about the context where it stops.
</p>
<pre><code>changequote(&lt;QUOTE&gt;,&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;)

Breakpoint 1, m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70)
    at builtin.c:879
879         if (bad_argc(TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[0]),argc,1,3))</code></pre>
<p>
	Now we use the command n (next) to advance execution to the next line of the current function.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) n
882         set_quotes((argc &gt;= 2) ? TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[1])\
: nil,</code></pre>
<p>
	set_quotes looks like a promising subroutine. We can go into it by using the command s (step) instead of next. step goes to the next line to be executed in any subroutine, so it steps into set_quotes.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) s
set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&lt;QUOTE&gt;", rq=0x34c88 "&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;")
    at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)</code></pre>
<p>
	The display that shows the subroutine where m4 is now suspended (and its arguments) is called a stack frame display. It shows a summary of the stack. We can use the backtrace command (which can also be spelled bt), to see where we are in the stack as a whole: the backtrace command displays a stack frame for each active subroutine.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) bt
#0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&lt;QUOTE&gt;", rq=0x34c88 "&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;")
    at input.c:530
#1  0x6344 in m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70)
    at builtin.c:882
#2  0x8174 in expand_macro (sym=0x33320) at macro.c:242
#3  0x7a88 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=209696, td=0xf7fffa30)
    at macro.c:71
#4  0x79dc in expand_input () at macro.c:40
#5  0x2930 in main (argc=0, argv=0xf7fffb20) at m4.c:195</code></pre>
<p>
	We step through a few more lines to see what happens. The first two times, we can use &lsquo;s&rsquo;; the next two times we use n to avoid falling into the xstrdup subroutine.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) s
0x3b5c  532         if (rquote != def_rquote)
(gdb) s
0x3b80  535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == '\0') ?  \
def_lquote : xstrdup(lq);
(gdb) n
536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == '\0') ? def_rquote\
: xstrdup(rq);
(gdb) n
538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);</code></pre>
<p>
	The last line displayed looks a little odd; we can examine the variables lquote and rquote to see if they are in fact the new left and right quotes we specified. We use the command p (print) to see their values.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p lquote
$1 = 0x35d40 "&lt;QUOTE&gt;"
(gdb) p rquote
$2 = 0x35d50 "&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;"</code></pre>
<p>
	lquote and rquote are indeed the new left and right quotes. To look at some context, we can display ten lines of source surrounding the current line with the l (list) command.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) l
533             xfree(rquote);
534
535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == '\0') ? def_lquote\
: xstrdup (lq);
536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == '\0') ? def_rquote\
: xstrdup (rq);
537
538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
540     }
541
542     void</code></pre>
<p>
	Let us step past the two lines that set len_lquote and len_rquote, and then examine the values of those variables.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) n
539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
(gdb) n
540     }
(gdb) p len_lquote
$3 = 9
(gdb) p len_rquote
$4 = 7</code></pre>
<p>
	That certainly looks wrong, assuming len_lquote and len_rquote are meant to be the lengths of lquote and rquote respectively. We can set them to better values using the p command, since it can print the value of any expression&mdash;and that expression can include subroutine calls and assignments.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p len_lquote=strlen(lquote)
$5 = 7
(gdb) p len_rquote=strlen(rquote)
$6 = 9</code></pre>
<p>
	Is that enough to fix the problem of using the new quotes with the m4 built&ndash;in defn? We can allow m4 to continue executing with the c (continue) command, and then try the example that caused trouble initially:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) c
Continuing.

define(baz,defn(&lt;QUOTE&gt;foo&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;))

baz
0000</code></pre>
<p>
	Success! The new quotes now work just as well as the default ones. The problem seems to have been just the two typos defining the wrong lengths. We allow m4 exit by giving it an EOF as input:
</p>
<pre><code>Ctrl-d
Program exited normally.</code></pre>
<p>
	The message &lsquo;Program exited normally.&rsquo; is from GDB; it indicates m4 has finished executing. We can end our GDB session with the GDB quit command.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) quit</code></pre>

<p>
	Invoke GDB by running the program gdb. Once started, GDB reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit.
</p>
<p>
	You can also run gdb with a variety of arguments and options, to specify more of your debugging environment at the outset.
</p>
<p>
	The command&ndash;line options described here are designed to cover a variety of situations; in some environments, some of these options may effectively be unavailable.
</p>
<p>
	The most usual way to start GDB is with one argument, specifying an executable program:
</p>
<pre><code>gdb program</code></pre>
<p>
	You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:
</p>
<pre><code>gdb program core</code></pre>
<p>
	You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument or use option &ndash;p, if you want to debug a running process:
</p>
<pre><code>gdb program 1234
gdb -p 1234</code></pre>
<p>
	would attach GDB to process 1234. With option &ndash;p you can omit the program filename.
</p>
<p>
	Taking advantage of the second command&ndash;line argument requires a fairly complete operating system; when you use GDB as a remote debugger attached to a bare board, there may not be any notion of &ldquo;process&rdquo;, and there is often no way to get a core dump. GDB will warn you if it is unable to attach or to read core dumps.
</p>
<p>
	You can optionally have gdb pass any arguments after the executable file to the inferior using &ndash;&ndash;args. This option stops option processing.
</p>
<pre><code>gdb --args gcc -O2 -c foo.c</code></pre>
<p>
	This will cause gdb to debug gcc, and to set gcc&rsquo;s command&ndash;line arguments (see Arguments) to &lsquo;&ndash;O2 &ndash;c foo.c&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
	You can run gdb without printing the front material, which describes GDB&rsquo;s non&ndash;warranty, by specifying &ndash;&ndash;silent (or &ndash;q/&ndash;&ndash;quiet):
</p>
<pre><code>gdb --silent</code></pre>
<p>
	You can further control how GDB starts up by using command&ndash;line options. GDB itself can remind you of the options available.
</p>
<p>
	Type
</p>
<pre><code>gdb -help</code></pre>
<p>
	to display all available options and briefly describe their use (&lsquo;gdb &ndash;h&rsquo; is a shorter equivalent).
</p>
<p>
	All options and command line arguments you give are processed in sequential order. The order makes a difference when the &lsquo;&ndash;x&rsquo; option is used.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_53944f93" href="#TOC_HEAD_53944f93">2.1.1 Choosing Files</a></H3>
<p>
	When GDB starts, it reads any arguments other than options as specifying an executable file and core file (or process ID). This is the same as if the arguments were specified by the &lsquo;&ndash;se&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;c&rsquo; (or &lsquo;&ndash;p&rsquo;) options respectively. (GDB reads the first argument that does not have an associated option flag as equivalent to the &lsquo;&ndash;se&rsquo; option followed by that argument; and the second argument that does not have an associated option flag, if any, as equivalent to the &lsquo;&ndash;c&rsquo;/&lsquo;&ndash;p&rsquo; option followed by that argument.) If the second argument begins with a decimal digit, GDB will first attempt to attach to it as a process, and if that fails, attempt to open it as a corefile. If you have a corefile whose name begins with a digit, you can prevent GDB from treating it as a pid by prefixing it with ./, e.g. ./12345.
</p>
<p>
	If GDB has not been configured to included core file support, such as for most embedded targets, then it will complain about a second argument and ignore it.
</p>
<p>
	For the &lsquo;&ndash;s&rsquo;, &lsquo;&ndash;e&rsquo;, and &lsquo;&ndash;se&rsquo; options, and their long form equivalents, the method used to search the file system for the symbol and/or executable file is the same as that used by the file command. See file.
</p>
<p>
	Many options have both long and short forms; both are shown in the following list. GDB also recognizes the long forms if you truncate them, so long as enough of the option is present to be unambiguous. (If you prefer, you can flag option arguments with &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;&ndash;&rsquo;, though we illustrate the more usual convention.)

DWARF unwind information is also not read, meaning backtraces may become incomplete or inaccurate. One use of this is when a user simply wants to do the following sequence: attach, dump core, detach. Loading the debugging information in this case is an unnecessary cause of delay.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_358b6e2b" href="#TOC_HEAD_358b6e2b">2.1.2 Choosing Modes</a></H3>
<p>
	You can run GDB in various alternative modes&mdash;for example, in batch mode or quiet mode.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-nx_0"><b>-nx</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-n_0"><b>-n</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Do not execute commands found in any initialization files (see Initialization Files).
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-nh_0"><b>-nh</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Do not execute commands found in any home directory initialization file (see Home directory initialization file). The system wide and current directory initialization files are still loaded.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-quiet_0"><b>-quiet</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-silent_0"><b>-silent</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-q_0"><b>-q</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		&ldquo;Quiet&rdquo;. Do not print the introductory and copyright messages. These messages are also suppressed in batch mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		This can also be enabled using set startup&ndash;quietly on. The default is off. Use show startup&ndash;quietly to see the current setting. Place set startup&ndash;quietly on into your early initialization file (see Initialization Files) to have future GDB sessions startup quietly.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-batch_0"><b>-batch</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Run in batch mode. Exit with status 0 after processing all the command files specified with &lsquo;&ndash;x&rsquo; (and all commands from initialization files, if not inhibited with &lsquo;&ndash;n&rsquo;). Exit with nonzero status if an error occurs in executing the GDB commands in the command files. Batch mode also disables pagination, sets unlimited terminal width and height see Screen Size, and acts as if set confirm off were in effect (see Messages/Warnings).
	</p>
	<p>
		Batch mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter, for example to download and run a program on another computer; in order to make this more useful, the message
	</p>
	<p>
		Program exited normally.
	</p>
	<p>
		(which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under GDB control terminates) is not issued when running in batch mode.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-batch-silent_0"><b>-batch-silent</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Run in batch mode exactly like &lsquo;&ndash;batch&rsquo;, but totally silently. All GDB output to stdout is prevented (stderr is unaffected). This is much quieter than &lsquo;&ndash;silent&rsquo; and would be useless for an interactive session.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is particularly useful when using targets that give &lsquo;Loading section&rsquo; messages, for example.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that targets that give their output via GDB, as opposed to writing directly to stdout, will also be made silent.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-return-child-result_0"><b>-return-child-result</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The return code from GDB will be the return code from the child process (the process being debugged), with the following exceptions:
	</p>
	<pre><code>GDB exits abnormally. E.g., due to an incorrect argument or an internal error. In this case the exit code is the same as it would have been without ‘-return-child-result’.
The user quits with an explicit value. E.g., ‘quit 1’.
The child process never runs, or is not allowed to terminate, in which case the exit code will be -1.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This option is useful in conjunction with &lsquo;&ndash;batch&rsquo; or &lsquo;&ndash;batch&ndash;silent&rsquo;, when GDB is being used as a remote program loader or simulator interface.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-nowindows_0"><b>-nowindows</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-nw_0"><b>-nw</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		&ldquo;No windows&rdquo;. If GDB comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) built in, then this option tells GDB to only use the command&ndash;line interface. If no GUI is available, this option has no effect.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-windows_0"><b>-windows</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-w_0"><b>-w</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If GDB includes a GUI, then this option requires it to be used if possible.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-cd_0"><b>-cd</b></a> directory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Run GDB using directory as its working directory, instead of the current directory.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-data-directory_0"><b>-data-directory</b></a> directory</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-D_0"><b>-D</b></a> directory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Run GDB using directory as its data directory. The data directory is where GDB searches for its auxiliary files. See Data Files.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-fullname_0"><b>-fullname</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-f_0"><b>-f</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GNU Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a subprocess. It tells GDB to output the full file name and line number in a standard, recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is displayed (which includes each time your program stops). This recognizable format looks like two &lsquo;\032&rsquo; characters, followed by the file name, line number and character position separated by colons, and a newline. The Emacs&ndash;to&ndash;GDB interface program uses the two &lsquo;\032&rsquo; characters as a signal to display the source code for the frame.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-annotate_0"><b>-annotate</b></a> level</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This option sets the annotation level inside GDB. Its effect is identical to using &lsquo;set annotate level&rsquo; (see Annotations). The annotation level controls how much information GDB prints together with its prompt, values of expressions, source lines, and other types of output. Level 0 is the normal, level 1 is for use when GDB is run as a subprocess of GNU Emacs, level 3 is the maximum annotation suitable for programs that control GDB, and level 2 has been deprecated.
	</p>
	<p>
		The annotation mechanism has largely been superseded by GDB/MI (see GDB/MI).
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_--args_0"><b>--args</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Change interpretation of command line so that arguments following the executable file are passed as command line arguments to the inferior. This option stops option processing.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-baud_0"><b>-baud</b></a> bps</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-b_0"><b>-b</b></a> bps</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any serial interface used by GDB for remote debugging.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-l_0"><b>-l</b></a> timeout</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the timeout (in seconds) of any communication used by GDB for remote debugging.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-tty_0"><b>-tty</b></a> device</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-t_0"><b>-t</b></a> device</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Run using device for your program&rsquo;s standard input and output.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-tui_0"><b>-tui</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Activate the Text User Interface when starting. The Text User Interface manages several text windows on the terminal, showing source, assembly, registers and GDB command outputs (see GDB Text User Interface). Do not use this option if you run GDB from Emacs (see Using GDB under GNU Emacs).
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-interpreter_0"><b>-interpreter</b></a> interp</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use the interpreter interp for interface with the controlling program or device. This option is meant to be set by programs which communicate with GDB using it as a back end. See Command Interpreters.
	</p>
	<p>
		&lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;interpreter=mi&rsquo; (or &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;interpreter=mi3&rsquo;) causes GDB to use the GDB/MI interface version 3 (see The GDB/MI Interface) included since GDB version 9.1. GDB/MI version 2 (mi2), included in GDB 6.0 and version 1 (mi1), included in GDB 5.3, are also available. Earlier GDB/MI interfaces are no longer supported.
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;<a name="wd_ln_write_0"><b>write</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Open the executable and core files for both reading and writing. This is equivalent to the &lsquo;set write on&rsquo; command inside GDB (see Patching).
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-statistics_0"><b>-statistics</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This option causes GDB to print statistics about time and memory usage after it completes each command and returns to the prompt.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-version_0"><b>-version</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This option causes GDB to print its version number and no&ndash;warranty blurb, and exit.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_-configuration_0"><b>-configuration</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This option causes GDB to print details about its build&ndash;time configuration parameters, and then exit. These details can be important when reporting GDB bugs (see GDB Bugs).
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_b5528994" href="#TOC_HEAD_b5528994">2.1.3 What GDB Does During Startup</a></H3>
<p>
	Here&rsquo;s the description of what GDB does during session startup:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Performs minimal setup required to initialize basic internal state.</li>
	<li>Reads commands from the early initialization file (if any) in your home directory. Only a restricted set of commands can be placed into an early initialization file, see Initialization Files, for details.</li>
	<li>Executes commands and command files specified by the &lsquo;&ndash;eiex&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;eix&rsquo; command line options in their specified order. Only a restricted set of commands can be used with &lsquo;&ndash;eiex&rsquo; and &lsquo;eix&rsquo;, see Initialization Files, for details.</li>
	<li>Sets up the command interpreter as specified by the command line (see interpreter).</li>
	<li>Reads the system wide initialization file and the files from the system wide initialization directory, see System Wide Init Files.</li>
	<li>Reads the initialization file (if any) in your home directory and executes all the commands in that file, see Home Directory Init File.</li>
	<li>Executes commands and command files specified by the &lsquo;&ndash;iex&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;ix&rsquo; options in their specified order. Usually you should use the &lsquo;&ndash;ex&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;x&rsquo; options instead, but this way you can apply settings before GDB init files get executed and before inferior gets loaded.</li>
	<li>Processes command line options and operands.</li>
	<li>Reads and executes the commands from the initialization file (if any) in the current working directory as long as &lsquo;set auto&ndash;load local&ndash;gdbinit&rsquo; is set to &lsquo;on&rsquo; (see Init File in the Current Directory). This is only done if the current directory is different from your home directory. Thus, you can have more than one init file, one generic in your home directory, and another, specific to the program you are debugging, in the directory where you invoke GDB. See Init File in the Current Directory during Startup.</li>
	<li>If the command line specified a program to debug, or a process to attach to, or a core file, GDB loads any auto&ndash;loaded scripts provided for the program or for its loaded shared libraries. See Auto&ndash;loading.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If you wish to disable the auto&ndash;loading during startup, you must do something like the following:
	</p>
	<p>
		$ gdb &ndash;iex &quot;set auto&ndash;load python&ndash;scripts off&quot; myprogram
	</p>
	<li>Option &lsquo;&ndash;ex&rsquo; does not work because the auto&ndash;loading is then turned off too late.</li>
	<li>Executes commands and command files specified by the &lsquo;&ndash;ex&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;x&rsquo; options in their specified order. See Command Files, for more details about GDB command files.</li>
	<li>Reads the command history recorded in the history file. See Command History, for more details about the command history and the files where GDB records it.</li>
	<br />
</ol>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_72ef1ffc" href="#TOC_HEAD_72ef1ffc">2.1.4 Initialization Files</a></H3>
<p>
	During startup (see Startup) GDB will execute commands from several initialization files. These initialization files use the same syntax as command files (see Command Files) and are processed by GDB in the same way.
</p>
<p>
	To display the list of initialization files loaded by GDB at startup, in the order they will be loaded, you can use gdb &ndash;&ndash;help.
</p>
<p>
	The early initialization file is loaded very early in GDB&rsquo;s initialization process, before the interpreter (see Interpreters) has been initialized, and before the default target (see Targets) is initialized. Only set or source commands should be placed into an early initialization file, and the only set commands that can be used are those that control how GDB starts up.
</p>
<p>
	Commands that can be placed into an early initialization file will be documented as such throughout this manual. Any command that is not documented as being suitable for an early initialization file should instead be placed into a general initialization file. Command files passed to &ndash;&ndash;early&ndash;init&ndash;command or &ndash;eix are also early initialization files, with the same command restrictions. Only commands that can appear in an early initialization file should be passed to &ndash;&ndash;early&ndash;init&ndash;eval&ndash;command or &ndash;eiex.
</p>
<p>
	In contrast, the general initialization files are processed later, after GDB has finished its own internal initialization process, any valid command can be used in these files.
</p>
<p>
	Throughout the rest of this document the term initialization file refers to one of the general initialization files, not the early initialization file. Any discussion of the early initialization file will specifically mention that it is the early initialization file being discussed.
</p>
<p>
	As the system wide and home directory initialization files are processed before most command line options, changes to settings (e.g. &lsquo;set complaints&rsquo;) can affect subsequent processing of command line options and operands.
</p>
<p>
	The following sections describe where GDB looks for the early initialization and initialization files, and the order that the files are searched for.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_b6231306" href="#TOC_HEAD_b6231306">2.1.4.1 Home directory early initialization files</a></H4>
<p>
	GDB initially looks for an early initialization file in the users home directory1. There are a number of locations that GDB will search in the home directory, these locations are searched in order and GDB will load the first file that it finds, and subsequent locations will not be checked.
</p>
<p>
	On non&ndash;macOS hosts the locations searched are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The file gdb/gdbearlyinit within the directory pointed to by the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME, if it is defined.</li>
	<li>The file .config/gdb/gdbearlyinit within the directory pointed to by the environment variable HOME, if it is defined.</li>
	<li>The file .gdbearlyinit within the directory pointed to by the environment variable HOME, if it is defined.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	By contrast, on macOS hosts the locations searched are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The file Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbearlyinit within the directory pointed to by the environment variable HOME, if it is defined.</li>
	<li>The file .gdbearlyinit within the directory pointed to by the environment variable HOME, if it is defined.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	It is possible to prevent the home directory early initialization file from being loaded using the &lsquo;&ndash;nx&rsquo; or &lsquo;&ndash;nh&rsquo; command line options, see Choosing Modes.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_7307a94" href="#TOC_HEAD_7307a94">2.1.4.2 System wide initialization files</a></H4>
<p>
	There are two locations that are searched for system wide initialization files. Both of these locations are always checked:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_system.gdbinit_0"><b>system.gdbinit</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is a single system&ndash;wide initialization file. Its location is specified with the &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;system&ndash;gdbinit configure option (see System&ndash;wide configuration). It is loaded first when GDB starts, before command line options have been processed.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_system.gdbinit.d_0"><b>system.gdbinit.d</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is the system&ndash;wide initialization directory. Its location is specified with the &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;system&ndash;gdbinit&ndash;dir configure option (see System&ndash;wide configuration). Files in this directory are loaded in alphabetical order immediately after system.gdbinit (if enabled) when GDB starts, before command line options have been processed. Files need to have a recognized scripting language extension (.py/.scm) or be named with a .gdb extension to be interpreted as regular GDB commands. GDB will not recurse into any subdirectories of this directory.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	It is possible to prevent the system wide initialization files from being loaded using the &lsquo;&ndash;nx&rsquo; command line option, see Choosing Modes.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_ab713e88" href="#TOC_HEAD_ab713e88">2.1.4.3 Home directory initialization file</a></H4>
<p>
	After loading the system wide initialization files GDB will look for an initialization file in the users home directory2. There are a number of locations that GDB will search in the home directory, these locations are searched in order and GDB will load the first file that it finds, and subsequent locations will not be checked.
</p>
<p>
	On non&ndash;Apple hosts the locations searched are:
</p>
<pre><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdb/gdbinit
$HOME/.config/gdb/gdbinit
$HOME/.gdbinit</code></pre>
<p>
	While on Apple hosts the locations searched are:
</p>
<pre><code>$HOME/Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbinit
$HOME/.gdbinit</code></pre>
<p>
	It is possible to prevent the home directory initialization file from being loaded using the &lsquo;&ndash;nx&rsquo; or &lsquo;&ndash;nh&rsquo; command line options, see Choosing Modes.
</p>
<p>
	The DJGPP port of GDB uses the name gdb.ini instead of .gdbinit or gdbinit, due to the limitations of file names imposed by DOS filesystems. The Windows port of GDB uses the standard name, but if it finds a gdb.ini file in your home directory, it warns you about that and suggests to rename the file to the standard name.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_7f942115" href="#TOC_HEAD_7f942115">2.1.4.4 Local directory initialization file</a></H4>
<p>
	GDB will check the current directory for a file called .gdbinit. It is loaded last, after command line options other than &lsquo;&ndash;x&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;ex&rsquo; have been processed. The command line options &lsquo;&ndash;x&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;ex&rsquo; are processed last, after .gdbinit has been loaded, see Choosing Files.
</p>
<p>
	If the file in the current directory was already loaded as the home directory initialization file then it will not be loaded a second time.
</p>
<p>
	It is possible to prevent the local directory initialization file from being loaded using the &lsquo;&ndash;nx&rsquo; command line option, see Choosing Modes.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_846020ac" href="#TOC_HEAD_846020ac">2.2 Quitting GDB</a></H2>
<pre><code>quit [expression]
exit [expression]
q</code></pre>
<p>
	To exit GDB, use the quit command (abbreviated q), the exit command, or type an end&ndash;of&ndash;file character (usually Ctrl&ndash;d). If you do not supply expression, GDB will terminate normally; otherwise it will terminate using the result of expression as the error code.
</p>
<p>
	An interrupt (often Ctrl&ndash;c) does not exit from GDB, but rather terminates the action of any GDB command that is in progress and returns to GDB command level. It is safe to type the interrupt character at any time because GDB does not allow it to take effect until a time when it is safe.
</p>
<p>
	If you have been using GDB to control an attached process or device, you can release it with the detach command (see Debugging an Already&ndash;running Process).
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_7faf3c81" href="#TOC_HEAD_7faf3c81">2.3 Shell Commands</a></H2>
<p>
	If you need to execute occasional shell commands during your debugging session, there is no need to leave or suspend GDB; you can just use the shell command.
</p>
<pre><code>shell command-string
!command-string</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Invoke a shell to execute command&ndash;string. Note that no space is needed between ! and command&ndash;string. On GNU and Unix systems, the environment variable SHELL, if it exists, determines which shell to run. Otherwise GDB uses the default shell (/bin/sh on GNU and Unix systems, cmd.exe on MS&ndash;Windows, COMMAND.COM on MS&ndash;DOS, etc.).
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	You may also invoke shell commands from expressions, using the $_shell convenience function. See $_shell convenience function.
</p>
<p>
	The utility make is often needed in development environments. You do not have to use the shell command for this purpose in GDB:
</p>
<pre><code>make make-args</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Execute the make program with the specified arguments. This is equivalent to &lsquo;shell make make&ndash;args&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>pipe [command] | shell_command
| [command] | shell_command
pipe -d delim command delim shell_command
| -d delim command delim shell_command</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Executes command and sends its output to shell_command. Note that no space is needed around |. If no command is provided, the last command executed is repeated.
	</p>
	<p>
	In case the command contains a |, the option &ndash;d delim can be used to specify an alternate delimiter string delim that separates the command from the shell_command.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Example:

(gdb) p var
$1 = {
black = 144,

	<H2><a name="HEAD_46951cca" href="#TOC_HEAD_46951cca">2.4 Logging Output</a></H2>
<p>
	You may want to save the output of GDB commands to a file. There are several commands to control GDB&rsquo;s logging.
</p>
<pre><code>set logging enabled [on|off]</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Enable or disable logging.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>set logging file file</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Change the name of the current logfile. The default logfile is gdb.txt.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>set logging overwrite [on|off]</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	By default, GDB will append to the logfile. Set overwrite if you want set logging enabled on to overwrite the logfile instead.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>set logging redirect [on|off]</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	By default, GDB output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set redirect if you want output to go only to the log file.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>set logging debugredirect [on|off]</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	By default, GDB debug output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set debugredirect if you want debug output to go only to the log file.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>show logging</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Show the current values of the logging settings.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	You can also redirect the output of a GDB command to a shell command. See pipe.
</p>
	<H1><a name="HEAD_e201cc30" href="#TOC_HEAD_e201cc30">3 GDB Commands</a></H1>
<p>
	You can abbreviate a GDB command to the first few letters of the command name, if that abbreviation is unambiguous; and you can repeat certain GDB commands by typing just RET. You can also use the TAB key to get GDB to fill out the rest of a word in a command (or to show you the alternatives available, if there is more than one possibility).
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_4e4562c2" href="#TOC_HEAD_4e4562c2">3.1 Command Syntax</a></H2>
<p>
	A GDB command is a single line of input. There is no limit on how long it can be. It starts with a command name, which is followed by arguments whose meaning depends on the command name. For example, the command step accepts an argument which is the number of times to step, as in &lsquo;step 5&rsquo;. You can also use the step command with no arguments. Some commands do not allow any arguments.
</p>
<p>
	GDB command names may always be truncated if that abbreviation is unambiguous. Other possible command abbreviations are listed in the documentation for individual commands. In some cases, even ambiguous abbreviations are allowed; for example, s is specially defined as equivalent to step even though there are other commands whose names start with s. You can test abbreviations by using them as arguments to the help command.
</p>
<p>
	A blank line as input to GDB (typing just RET) means to repeat the previous command. Certain commands (for example, run) will not repeat this way; these are commands whose unintentional repetition might cause trouble and which you are unlikely to want to repeat. User&ndash;defined commands can disable this feature; see dont&ndash;repeat.
</p>
<p>
	The list and x commands, when you repeat them with RET, construct new arguments rather than repeating exactly as typed. This permits easy scanning of source or memory.
</p>
<p>
	GDB can also use RET in another way: to partition lengthy output, in a way similar to the common utility more (see Screen Size). Since it is easy to press one RET too many in this situation, GDB disables command repetition after any command that generates this sort of display.
</p>
<p>
	Any text from a # to the end of the line is a comment; it does nothing. This is useful mainly in command files (see Command Files).
</p>
<p>
	The Ctrl&ndash;o binding is useful for repeating a complex sequence of commands. This command accepts the current line, like RET, and then fetches the next line relative to the current line from the history for editing.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_7f4d9961" href="#TOC_HEAD_7f4d9961">3.2 Command Settings</a></H2>
<p>
	Many commands change their behavior according to command&ndash;specific variables or settings. These settings can be changed with the set subcommands. For example, the print command (see Examining Data) prints arrays differently depending on settings changeable with the commands set print elements NUMBER&ndash;OF&ndash;ELEMENTS and set print array&ndash;indexes, among others.
</p>
<p>
	You can change these settings to your preference in the gdbinit files loaded at GDB startup. See Startup.
</p>
<p>
	The settings can also be changed interactively during the debugging session. For example, to change the limit of array elements to print, you can do the following:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set print elements 10
(gdb) print some_array
$1 = {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90...}</code></pre>
<p>
	The above set print elements 10 command changes the number of elements to print from the default of 200 to 10. If you only intend this limit of 10 to be used for printing some_array, then you must restore the limit back to 200, with set print elements 200.
</p>
<p>
	Some commands allow overriding settings with command options. For example, the print command supports a number of options that allow overriding relevant global print settings as set by set print subcommands. See print options. The example above could be rewritten as:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print -elements 10 -- some_array
$1 = {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90...}</code></pre>
<p>
	Alternatively, you can use the with command to change a setting temporarily, for the duration of a command invocation.
</p>
<pre><code>with setting [value] [-- command]
w setting [value] [-- command]</code></pre>
<p>
	Temporarily set setting to value for the duration of command.
</p>
<p>
	setting is any setting you can change with the set subcommands. value is the value to assign to setting while running command.
</p>
<p>
	If no command is provided, the last command executed is repeated.
</p>
<p>
	If a command is provided, it must be preceded by a double dash (&ndash;&ndash;) separator. This is required because some settings accept free&ndash;form arguments, such as expressions or filenames.
</p>
<p>
	For example, the command
</p>
<p>
	(gdb) with print array on &ndash;&ndash; print some_array
</p>
<p>
	is equivalent to the following 3 commands:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set print array on
(gdb) print some_array
(gdb) set print array off</code></pre>
<p>
	The with command is particularly useful when you want to override a setting while running user&ndash;defined commands, or commands defined in Python or Guile. See Extending GDB.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) with print pretty on -- my_complex_command</code></pre>
<p>
	To change several settings for the same command, you can nest with commands. For example, with language ada &ndash;&ndash; with print elements 10 temporarily changes the language to Ada and sets a limit of 10 elements to print for arrays and strings.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_a9e83ff9" href="#TOC_HEAD_a9e83ff9">3.3 Command Completion</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB can fill in the rest of a word in a command for you, if there is only one possibility; it can also show you what the valid possibilities are for the next word in a command, at any time. This works for GDB commands, GDB subcommands, command options, and the names of symbols in your program.
</p>
<p>
	Press the TAB key whenever you want GDB to fill out the rest of a word. If there is only one possibility, GDB fills in the word, and waits for you to finish the command (or press RET to enter it). For example, if you type
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info breTAB</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB fills in the rest of the word &lsquo;breakpoints&rsquo;, since that is the only info subcommand beginning with &lsquo;bre&rsquo;:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info breakpoints</code></pre>
<p>
	You can either press RET at this point, to run the info breakpoints command, or backspace and enter something else, if &lsquo;breakpoints&rsquo; does not look like the command you expected. (If you were sure you wanted info breakpoints in the first place, you might as well just type RET immediately after &lsquo;info bre&rsquo;, to exploit command abbreviations rather than command completion).
</p>
<p>
	If there is more than one possibility for the next word when you press TAB, GDB sounds a bell. You can either supply more characters and try again, or just press TAB a second time; GDB displays all the possible completions for that word. For example, you might want to set a breakpoint on a subroutine whose name begins with &lsquo;make_&rsquo;, but when you type b make_TAB GDB just sounds the bell. Typing TAB again displays all the function names in your program that begin with those characters, for example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) b make_TAB</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB sounds bell; press TAB again, to see:
</p>
<pre><code>make_a_section_from_file     make_environ
make_abs_section             make_function_type
make_blockvector             make_pointer_type
make_cleanup                 make_reference_type
make_command                 make_symbol_completion_list
(gdb) b make_</code></pre>
<p>
	After displaying the available possibilities, GDB copies your partial input (&lsquo;b make_&rsquo; in the example) so you can finish the command.
</p>
<p>
	If the command you are trying to complete expects either a keyword or a number to follow, then &lsquo;NUMBER&rsquo; will be shown among the available completions, for example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print -elements TABTAB
NUMBER     unlimited
(gdb) print -elements</code></pre>
<p>
	Here, the option expects a number (e.g., 100), not literal NUMBER. Such metasyntactical arguments are always presented in uppercase.
</p>
<p>
	If you just want to see the list of alternatives in the first place, you can press M&ndash;? rather than pressing TAB twice. M&ndash;? means META ?. You can type this either by holding down a key designated as the META shift on your keyboard (if there is one) while typing ?, or as ESC followed by ?.
</p>
<p>
	If the number of possible completions is large, GDB will print as much of the list as it has collected, as well as a message indicating that the list may be truncated.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) b mTABTAB
main
&lt;... the rest of the possible completions ...&gt;
*** List may be truncated, max-completions reached. ***
(gdb) b m</code></pre>
<p>
	This behavior can be controlled with the following commands:
</p>
<pre><code>set max-completions limit
set max-completions unlimited</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Set the maximum number of completion candidates. GDB will stop looking for more completions once it collects this many candidates. This is useful when completing on things like function names as collecting all the possible candidates can be time consuming. The default value is 200. A value of zero disables tab&ndash;completion. Note that setting either no limit or a very large limit can make completion slow.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>show max-completions</code></pre>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Show the maximum number of candidates that GDB will collect and show during completion.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Sometimes the string you need, while logically a &ldquo;word&rdquo;, may contain parentheses or other characters that GDB normally excludes from its notion of a word. To permit word completion to work in this situation, you may enclose words in &#039; (single quote marks) in GDB commands.
</p>
<p>
	A likely situation where you might need this is in typing an expression that involves a C++ symbol name with template parameters. This is because when completing expressions, GDB treats the &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo; character as word delimiter, assuming that it&rsquo;s the less&ndash;than comparison operator (see C and C++ Operators).
</p>
<p>
	For example, when you want to call a C++ template function interactively using the print or call commands, you may need to distinguish whether you mean the version of name that was specialized for int, name&lt;int&gt;(), or the version that was specialized for float, name&lt;float&gt;(). To use the word&ndash;completion facilities in this situation, type a single quote &#039; at the beginning of the function name. This alerts GDB that it may need to consider more information than usual when you press TAB or M&ndash;? to request word completion:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p 'func&lt;M-?
func&lt;int&gt;()    func&lt;float&gt;()
(gdb) p 'func&lt;</code></pre>
<p>
	When setting breakpoints however (see Location Specifications), you don&rsquo;t usually need to type a quote before the function name, because GDB understands that you want to set a breakpoint on a function:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) b func&lt;M-?
func&lt;int&gt;()    func&lt;float&gt;()
(gdb) b func&lt;</code></pre>
<p>
	This is true even in the case of typing the name of C++ overloaded functions (multiple definitions of the same function, distinguished by argument type). For example, when you want to set a breakpoint you don&rsquo;t need to distinguish whether you mean the version of name that takes an int parameter, name(int), or the version that takes a float parameter, name(float).
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) b bubble(M-?
bubble(int)    bubble(double)
(gdb) b bubble(douM-?
bubble(double)</code></pre>
<p>
	See quoting names for a description of other scenarios that require quoting.
</p>
<p>
	For more information about overloaded functions, see C++ Expressions. You can use the command set overload&ndash;resolution off to disable overload resolution; see GDB Features for C++.
</p>
<p>
	When completing in an expression which looks up a field in a structure, GDB also tries3 to limit completions to the field names available in the type of the left&ndash;hand&ndash;side:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p gdb_stdout.M-?
magic                to_fputs             to_rewind
to_data              to_isatty            to_write
to_delete            to_put               to_write_async_safe
to_flush             to_read</code></pre>
<p>
	This is because the gdb_stdout is a variable of the type struct ui_file that is defined in GDB sources as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>struct ui_file
{
int *magic;
ui_file_flush_ftype *to_flush;
ui_file_write_ftype *to_write;
ui_file_write_async_safe_ftype *to_write_async_safe;
ui_file_fputs_ftype *to_fputs;
ui_file_read_ftype *to_read;
ui_file_delete_ftype *to_delete;
ui_file_isatty_ftype *to_isatty;
ui_file_rewind_ftype *to_rewind;
ui_file_put_ftype *to_put;
void *to_data;
}</code></pre>
<p>

<p>
	The completer can be confused by certain kinds of invalid expressions. Also, it only examines the static type of the expression, not the dynamic type.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_26872dc2" href="#TOC_HEAD_26872dc2">3.4 Command options</a></H2>
<p>
	Some commands accept options starting with a leading dash. For example, print &ndash;pretty. Similarly to command names, you can abbreviate a GDB option to the first few letters of the option name, if that abbreviation is unambiguous, and you can also use the TAB key to get GDB to fill out the rest of a word in an option (or to show you the alternatives available, if there is more than one possibility).
</p>
<p>
	Some commands take raw input as argument. For example, the print command processes arbitrary expressions in any of the languages supported by GDB. With such commands, because raw input may start with a leading dash that would be confused with an option or any of its abbreviations, e.g. print &ndash;p (short for print &ndash;pretty or printing negative p?), if you specify any command option, then you must use a double&ndash;dash (&ndash;&ndash;) delimiter to indicate the end of options.
</p>
<p>
	Some options are described as accepting an argument which can be either on or off. These are known as boolean options. Similarly to boolean settings commands&mdash;on and off are the typical values, but any of 1, yes and enable can also be used as &ldquo;true&rdquo; value, and any of 0, no and disable can also be used as &ldquo;false&rdquo; value. You can also omit a &ldquo;true&rdquo; value, as it is implied by default.
</p>
<p>
	For example, these are equivalent:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print -object on -pretty off -element unlimited -- *myptr
(gdb) p -o -p 0 -e u -- *myptr</code></pre>
<p>
	You can discover the set of options some command accepts by completing on &ndash; after the command name. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print -TABTAB
-address         -max-depth               -object          -static-members
-array           -memory-tag-violations   -pretty          -symbol
-array-indexes   -nibbles                 -raw-values      -union
-elements        -null-stop               -repeats         -vtbl</code></pre>
<p>
	Completion will in some cases guide you with a suggestion of what kind of argument an option expects. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print -elements TABTAB
NUMBER     unlimited</code></pre>
<p>
	Here, the option expects a number (e.g., 100), not literal NUMBER. Such metasyntactical arguments are always presented in uppercase.
</p>

	In addition to help, you can use the GDB commands info and show to inquire about the state of your program, or the state of GDB itself. Each command supports many topics of inquiry; this manual introduces each of them in the appropriate context. The listings under info and under show in the Command, Variable, and Function Index point to all the sub&ndash;commands. See Command and Variable Index.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info_0"><b>info</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command (abbreviated i) is for describing the state of your program. For example, you can show the arguments passed to a function with info args, list the registers currently in use with info registers, or list the breakpoints you have set with info breakpoints. You can get a complete list of the info sub&ndash;commands with help info.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set_0"><b>set</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		You can assign the result of an expression to an environment variable with set. For example, you can set the GDB prompt to a $&ndash;sign with set prompt $.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show_0"><b>show</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		In contrast to info, show is for describing the state of GDB itself. You can change most of the things you can show, by using the related command set; for example, you can control what number system is used for displays with set radix, or simply inquire which is currently in use with show radix.
	</p>
	<p>
		To display all the settable parameters and their current values, you can use show with no arguments; you may also use info set. Both commands produce the same display.
	</p>

<p>
	Here are several miscellaneous show subcommands, all of which are exceptional in lacking corresponding set commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show version_0"><b>show version</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show what version of GDB is running. You should include this information in GDB bug&ndash;reports. If multiple versions of GDB are in use at your site, you may need to determine which version of GDB you are running; as GDB evolves, new commands are introduced, and old ones may wither away. Also, many system vendors ship variant versions of GDB, and there are variant versions of GDB in GNU/Linux distributions as well. The version number is the same as the one announced when you start GDB.

	<H1><a name="HEAD_ee1190d9" href="#TOC_HEAD_ee1190d9">4 Running Programs Under GDB</a></H1>
<p>
	When you run a program under GDB, you must first generate debugging information when you compile it.
</p>
<p>
	You may start GDB with its arguments, if any, in an environment of your choice. If you are doing native debugging, you may redirect your program&rsquo;s input and output, debug an already running process, or kill a child process.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_888ce5fe" href="#TOC_HEAD_888ce5fe">4.1 Compiling for Debugging</a></H2>
<p>
	In order to debug a program effectively, you need to generate debugging information when you compile it. This debugging information is stored in the object file; it describes the data type of each variable or function and the correspondence between source line numbers and addresses in the executable code.
</p>
<p>
	To request debugging information, specify the &lsquo;&ndash;g&rsquo; option when you run the compiler.
</p>
<p>
	Programs that are to be shipped to your customers are compiled with optimizations, using the &lsquo;&ndash;O&rsquo; compiler option. However, some compilers are unable to handle the &lsquo;&ndash;g&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;O&rsquo; options together. Using those compilers, you cannot generate optimized executables containing debugging information.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="HEAD_HIDDEN_1f522b82">GCC, the GNU C/C++ compiler, supports &lsquo;&ndash;g&rsquo; with or without &lsquo;&ndash;O&rsquo;, making it possible to <strong>debug optimized code</strong>. &nbsp;<a href="../tags/Debug-opt.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>Debug-opt</a></li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	We recommend that you always use &lsquo;&ndash;g&rsquo; whenever you compile a program. You may think your program is correct, but there is no sense in pushing your luck. For more information, see Optimized Code.
</p>
<p>
	Older versions of the GNU C compiler permitted a variant option &lsquo;&ndash;gg&rsquo; for debugging information. GDB no longer supports this format; if your GNU C compiler has this option, do not use it.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="HEAD_HIDDEN_8301e8fd">GDB knows about preprocessor macros and can show you their expansion (see Macros). &nbsp;<a href="../tags/Debug-macro.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>Debug-macro</a></li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	Most compilers do not include information about preprocessor macros in the debugging information if you specify the &ndash;g flag alone. Version 3.1 and later of GCC, the GNU C compiler, provides macro information if you are using the DWARF debugging format, and specify the option &ndash;g3.
</p>
<p>
	See Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC in Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), for more information on GCC options affecting debug information.
</p>
<p>
	You will have the best debugging experience if you use the latest version of the DWARF debugging format that your compiler supports. DWARF is currently the most expressive and best supported debugging format in GDB.

<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_run_0"><b>run</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_r_0"><b>r</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use the run command to start your program under GDB. You must first specify the program name with an argument to GDB (see Getting In and Out of GDB), or by using the file or exec&ndash;file command (see Commands to Specify Files).
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If you are running your program in an execution environment that supports processes, run creates an inferior process and makes that process run your program. In some environments without processes, run jumps to the start of your program. Other targets, like &lsquo;remote&rsquo;, are always running. If you get an error message like this one:
</p>
<pre><code>The "remote" target does not support "run".
Try "help target" or "continue".</code></pre>
<p>
	then use continue to run your program. You may need load first (see load).
</p>
<p>
	The execution of a program is affected by certain information it receives from its superior. GDB provides ways to specify this information, which you must do before starting your program. (You can change it after starting your program, but such changes only affect your program the next time you start it.) This information may be divided into four categories:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The arguments.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specify the arguments to give your program as the arguments of the run command. If a shell is available on your target, the shell is used to pass the arguments, so that you may use normal conventions (such as wildcard expansion or variable substitution) in describing the arguments. In Unix systems, you can control which shell is used with the SHELL environment variable. If you do not define SHELL, GDB uses the default shell (/bin/sh). You can disable use of any shell with the set startup&ndash;with&ndash;shell command (see below for details).
	</p>
	<li>The environment.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Your program normally inherits its environment from GDB, but you can use the GDB commands set environment and unset environment to change parts of the environment that affect your program. See Your Program&rsquo;s Environment.
	</p>
	<li>The working directory.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		You can set your program&rsquo;s working directory with the command set cwd. If you do not set any working directory with this command, your program will inherit GDB&rsquo;s working directory if native debugging, or the remote server&rsquo;s working directory if remote debugging. See Your Program&rsquo;s Working Directory.
	</p>
	<li>The standard input and output.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Your program normally uses the same device for standard input and standard output as GDB is using. You can redirect input and output in the run command line, or you can use the tty command to set a different device for your program. See Your Program&rsquo;s Input and Output.
	</p>
	<p>
		Warning: While input and output redirection work, you cannot use pipes to pass the output of the program you are debugging to another program; if you attempt this, GDB is likely to wind up debugging the wrong program.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	When you issue the run command, your program begins to execute immediately. See Stopping and Continuing, for discussion of how to arrange for your program to stop. Once your program has stopped, you may call functions in your program, using the print or call commands. See Examining Data.
</p>
<p>
	If the modification time of your symbol file has changed since the last time GDB read its symbols, GDB discards its symbol table, and reads it again. When it does this, GDB tries to retain your current breakpoints.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_start_0"><b>start</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The name of the main procedure can vary from language to language. With C or C++, the main procedure name is always main, but other languages such as Ada do not require a specific name for their main procedure. The debugger provides a convenient way to start the execution of the program and to stop at the beginning of the main procedure, depending on the language used.
	</p>
	<p>
		The &lsquo;start&rsquo; command does the equivalent of setting a temporary breakpoint at the beginning of the main procedure and then invoking the &lsquo;run&rsquo; command.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some programs contain an elaboration phase where some startup code is executed before the main procedure is called. This depends on the languages used to write your program. In C++, for instance, constructors for static and global objects are executed before main is called. It is therefore possible that the debugger stops before reaching the main procedure. However, the temporary breakpoint will remain to halt execution.
	</p>
	<p>
		Specify the arguments to give to your program as arguments to the &lsquo;start&rsquo; command. These arguments will be given verbatim to the underlying &lsquo;run&rsquo; command. Note that the same arguments will be reused if no argument is provided during subsequent calls to &lsquo;start&rsquo; or &lsquo;run&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is sometimes necessary to debug the program during elaboration. In these cases, using the start command would stop the execution of your program too late, as the program would have already completed the elaboration phase. Under these circumstances, either insert breakpoints in your elaboration code before running your program or use the starti command.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_starti_0"><b>starti</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The &lsquo;starti&rsquo; command does the equivalent of setting a temporary breakpoint at the first instruction of a program&rsquo;s execution and then invoking the &lsquo;run&rsquo; command. For programs containing an elaboration phase, the starti command will stop execution at the start of the elaboration phase.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set exec-wrapper wrapper_0"><b>set exec-wrapper wrapper</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show exec-wrapper_0"><b>show exec-wrapper</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_unset exec-wrapper_0"><b>unset exec-wrapper</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When &lsquo;exec&ndash;wrapper&rsquo; is set, the specified wrapper is used to launch programs for debugging. GDB starts your program with a shell command of the form exec wrapper program. Quoting is added to program and its arguments, but not to wrapper, so you should add quotes if appropriate for your shell. The wrapper runs until it executes your program, and then GDB takes control.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use any program that eventually calls execve with its arguments as a wrapper. Several standard Unix utilities do this, e.g. env and nohup. Any Unix shell script ending with exec &quot;$@&quot; will also work.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, you can use env to pass an environment variable to the debugged program, without setting the variable in your shell&rsquo;s environment:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) set exec-wrapper env 'LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so'
(gdb) run	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This command is available when debugging locally on most targets, excluding DJGPP, Cygwin, MS Windows, and QNX Neutrino.

	<li><a name="wd_ln_show startup-with-shell_0"><b>show startup-with-shell</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		On Unix systems, by default, if a shell is available on your target, GDB) uses it to start your program. Arguments of the run command are passed to the shell, which does variable substitution, expands wildcard characters and performs redirection of I/O. In some circumstances, it may be useful to disable such use of a shell, for example, when debugging the shell itself or diagnosing startup failures such as:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) run
Starting program: ./a.out
During startup program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		which indicates the shell or the wrapper specified with &lsquo;exec&ndash;wrapper&rsquo; crashed, not your program. Most often, this is caused by something odd in your shell&rsquo;s non&ndash;interactive mode initialization file&mdash;such as .cshrc for C&ndash;shell, $.zshenv for the Z shell, or the file specified in the BASH_ENV environment variable for BASH.

	<br />
	<p>
		By default, if the current inferior is not connected to any target yet (e.g., with target remote), the run command starts your program as a native process under GDB, on your local machine. If you&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t want to debug programs on your local machine, you can tell GDB to not connect to the native target automatically with the set auto&ndash;connect&ndash;native&ndash;target off command.
	</p>
	<p>
		If on, which is the default, and if the current inferior is not connected to a target already, the run command automaticaly connects to the native target, if one is available.
	</p>
	<p>
		If off, and if the current inferior is not connected to a target already, the run command fails with an error:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) run
Don't know how to run.  Try "help target".	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If the current inferior is already connected to a target, GDB always uses it with the run command.
	</p>
	<p>
		In any case, you can explicitly connect to the native target with the target native command. For example,
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) set auto-connect-native-target off
(gdb) run
Don't know how to run.  Try "help target".
(gdb) target native
(gdb) run
Starting program: ./a.out
[Inferior 1 (process 10421) exited normally]	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In case you connected explicitly to the native target, GDB remains connected even if all inferiors exit, ready for the next run command. Use the disconnect command to disconnect.
	</p>
	<p>
		Examples of other commands that likewise respect the auto&ndash;connect&ndash;native&ndash;target setting: attach, info proc, info os.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set disable-randomization_0"><b>set disable-randomization</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set disable-randomization on_0"><b>set disable-randomization on</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This option (enabled by default in GDB) will turn off the native randomization of the virtual address space of the started program. This option is useful for multiple debugging sessions to make the execution better reproducible and memory addresses reusable across debugging sessions.
	</p>
	<p>
		This feature is implemented only on certain targets, including GNU/Linux. On GNU/Linux you can get the same behavior using
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) set exec-wrapper setarch `uname -m` -R	</code></pre>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set disable-randomization off_0"><b>set disable-randomization off</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Leave the behavior of the started executable unchanged. Some bugs rear their ugly heads only when the program is loaded at certain addresses. If your bug disappears when you run the program under GDB, that might be because GDB by default disables the address randomization on platforms, such as GNU/Linux, which do that for stand&ndash;alone programs. Use set disable&ndash;randomization off to try to reproduce such elusive bugs.
	</p>
	<p>
		On targets where it is available, virtual address space randomization protects the programs against certain kinds of security attacks. In these cases the attacker needs to know the exact location of a concrete executable code. Randomizing its location makes it impossible to inject jumps misusing a code at its expected addresses.
	</p>
	<p>
		Prelinking shared libraries provides a startup performance advantage but it makes addresses in these libraries predictable for privileged processes by having just unprivileged access at the target system. Reading the shared library binary gives enough information for assembling the malicious code misusing it. Still even a prelinked shared library can get loaded at a new random address just requiring the regular relocation process during the startup. Shared libraries not already prelinked are always loaded at a randomly chosen address.
	</p>
	<p>
		Position independent executables (PIE) contain position independent code similar to the shared libraries and therefore such executables get loaded at a randomly chosen address upon startup. PIE executables always load even already prelinked shared libraries at a random address. You can build such executable using gcc &ndash;fPIE &ndash;pie.
	</p>
	<p>
		Heap (malloc storage), stack and custom mmap areas are always placed randomly (as long as the randomization is enabled).

	<H2><a name="HEAD_fe018a6e" href="#TOC_HEAD_fe018a6e">4.3 Your Program&rsquo;s Arguments</a></H2>
<p>
	The arguments to your program can be specified by the arguments of the run command. They are passed to a shell, which expands wildcard characters and performs redirection of I/O, and thence to your program. Your SHELL environment variable (if it exists) specifies what shell GDB uses. If you do not define SHELL, GDB uses the default shell (/bin/sh on Unix).
</p>
<p>
	On non&ndash;Unix systems, the program is usually invoked directly by GDB, which emulates I/O redirection via the appropriate system calls, and the wildcard characters are expanded by the startup code of the program, not by the shell.
</p>
<p>
	run with no arguments uses the same arguments used by the previous run, or those set by the set args command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set args_0"><b>set args</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specify the arguments to be used the next time your program is run. If set args has no arguments, run executes your program with no arguments. Once you have run your program with arguments, using set args before the next run is the only way to run it again without arguments.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show args_0"><b>show args</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the arguments to give your program when it is started.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_e207648a" href="#TOC_HEAD_e207648a">4.4 Your Program&rsquo;s Environment</a></H2>
<p>
	The environment consists of a set of environment variables and their values. Environment variables conventionally record such things as your user name, your home directory, your terminal type, and your search path for programs to run. Usually you set up environment variables with the shell and they are inherited by all the other programs you run. When debugging, it can be useful to try running your program with a modified environment without having to start GDB over again.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_path_0"><b>path</b></a> directory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Add directory to the front of the PATH environment variable (the search path for executables) that will be passed to your program. The value of PATH used by GDB does not change. You may specify several directory names, separated by whitespace or by a system&ndash;dependent separator character (&lsquo;:&rsquo; on Unix, &lsquo;;&rsquo; on MS&ndash;DOS and MS&ndash;Windows). If directory is already in the path, it is moved to the front, so it is searched sooner.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use the string &lsquo;$cwd&rsquo; to refer to whatever is the current working directory at the time GDB searches the path. If you use &lsquo;.&rsquo; instead, it refers to the directory where you executed the path command. GDB replaces &lsquo;.&rsquo; in the directory argument (with the current path) before adding directory to the search path.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show paths_0"><b>show paths</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the list of search paths for executables (the PATH environment variable).
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show environment_0"><b>show environment</b></a> [varname]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the value of environment variable varname to be given to your program when it starts. If you do not supply varname, print the names and values of all environment variables to be given to your program. You can abbreviate environment as env.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set environment varname_0"><b>set environment varname</b></a> [=value]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set environment variable varname to value. The value changes for your program (and the shell GDB uses to launch it), not for GDB itself. The value may be any string; the values of environment variables are just strings, and any interpretation is supplied by your program itself. The value parameter is optional; if it is eliminated, the variable is set to a null value.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, this command:
	</p>
	<pre><code>set env USER = foo	</code></pre>
	<p>
		tells the debugged program, when subsequently run, that its user is named &lsquo;foo&rsquo;. (The spaces around &lsquo;=&rsquo; are used for clarity here; they are not actually required.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that on Unix systems, GDB runs your program via a shell, which also inherits the environment set with set environment. If necessary, you can avoid that by using the &lsquo;env&rsquo; program as a wrapper instead of using set environment. See set exec&ndash;wrapper, for an example doing just that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Environment variables that are set by the user are also transmitted to gdbserver to be used when starting the remote inferior. see QEnvironmentHexEncoded.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_unset environment_0"><b>unset environment</b></a> varname</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Remove variable varname from the environment to be passed to your program. This is different from &lsquo;set env varname =&rsquo;; unset environment removes the variable from the environment, rather than assigning it an empty value.
	</p>
	<p>
		Environment variables that are unset by the user are also unset on gdbserver when starting the remote inferior. see QEnvironmentUnset.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Warning: On Unix systems, GDB runs your program using the shell indicated by your SHELL environment variable if it exists (or /bin/sh if not). If your SHELL variable names a shell that runs an initialization file when started non&ndash;interactively&mdash;such as .cshrc for C&ndash;shell, $.zshenv for the Z shell, or the file specified in the BASH_ENV environment variable for BASH&mdash;any variables you set in that file affect your program. You may wish to move setting of environment variables to files that are only run when you sign on, such as .login or .profile.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_c8530574" href="#TOC_HEAD_c8530574">4.5 Your Program&rsquo;s Working Directory</a></H2>
<p>
	Each time you start your program with run, the inferior will be initialized with the current working directory specified by the set cwd command. If no directory has been specified by this command, then the inferior will inherit GDB&rsquo;s current working directory as its working directory if native debugging, or it will inherit the remote server&rsquo;s current working directory if remote debugging.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set cwd_0"><b>set cwd</b></a> [directory]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the inferior&rsquo;s working directory to directory, which will be glob&ndash;expanded in order to resolve tildes (&tilde;). If no argument has been specified, the command clears the setting and resets it to an empty state. This setting has no effect on GDB&rsquo;s working directory, and it only takes effect the next time you start the inferior. The &tilde; in directory is a short for the home directory, usually pointed to by the HOME environment variable. On MS&ndash;Windows, if HOME is not defined, GDB uses the concatenation of HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH as fallback.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also change GDB&rsquo;s current working directory by using the cd command. See cd command.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show cwd_0"><b>show cwd</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the inferior&rsquo;s working directory. If no directory has been specified by set cwd, then the default inferior&rsquo;s working directory is the same as GDB&rsquo;s working directory.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_cd_0"><b>cd</b></a> [directory]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the GDB working directory to directory. If not given, directory uses &#039;&tilde;&#039;.
	</p>
	<p>
		The GDB working directory serves as a default for the commands that specify files for GDB to operate on. See Commands to Specify Files. See set cwd command.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_pwd_0"><b>pwd</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the GDB working directory.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	It is generally impossible to find the current working directory of the process being debugged (since a program can change its directory during its run). If you work on a system where GDB supports the info proc command (see Process Information), you can use the info proc command to find out the current working directory of the debuggee.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_ca32d98b" href="#TOC_HEAD_ca32d98b">4.6 Your Program&rsquo;s Input and Output</a></H2>
<p>
	By default, the program you run under GDB does input and output to the same terminal that GDB uses. GDB switches the terminal to its own terminal modes to interact with you, but it records the terminal modes your program was using and switches back to them when you continue running your program.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info terminal</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays information recorded by GDB about the terminal modes your program is using.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	You can redirect your program&rsquo;s input and/or output using shell redirection with the run command. For example,
</p>
<pre><code>run &gt; outfile</code></pre>
<p>
	starts your program, diverting its output to the file outfile.
</p>
<p>
	Another way to specify where your program should do input and output is with the tty command. This command accepts a file name as argument, and causes this file to be the default for future run commands. It also resets the controlling terminal for the child process, for future run commands. For example,
</p>
<pre><code>tty /dev/ttyb</code></pre>
<p>
	directs that processes started with subsequent run commands default to do input and output on the terminal /dev/ttyb and have that as their controlling terminal.
</p>
<p>
	An explicit redirection in run overrides the tty command&rsquo;s effect on the input/output device, but not its effect on the controlling terminal.
</p>
<p>
	When you use the tty command or redirect input in the run command, only the input for your program is affected. The input for GDB still comes from your terminal. tty is an alias for set inferior&ndash;tty.
</p>
<p>
	You can use the show inferior&ndash;tty command to tell GDB to display the name of the terminal that will be used for future runs of your program.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set inferior-tty_0"><b>set inferior-tty</b></a> [ tty ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the tty for the program being debugged to tty. Omitting tty restores the default behavior, which is to use the same terminal as GDB.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show inferior-tty_0"><b>show inferior-tty</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current tty for the program being debugged.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_f0c37c3b" href="#TOC_HEAD_f0c37c3b">4.7 Debugging an Already&ndash;running Process</a></H2>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_attach_0"><b>attach</b></a> process&ndash;id</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command attaches to a running process&mdash;one that was started outside GDB. (info files shows your active targets.) The command takes as argument a process ID. The usual way to find out the process&ndash;id of a Unix process is with the ps utility, or with the &lsquo;jobs &ndash;l&rsquo; shell command.
	</p>
	<p>
		attach does not repeat if you press RET a second time after executing the command.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	To use attach, your program must be running in an environment which supports processes; for example, attach does not work for programs on bare&ndash;board targets that lack an operating system. You must also have permission to send the process a signal.
</p>
<p>
	When you use attach, the debugger finds the program running in the process first by looking in the current working directory, then (if the program is not found) by using the source file search path (see Specifying Source Directories). You can also use the file command to load the program. See Commands to Specify Files.
</p>
<p>
	If the debugger can determine that the executable file running in the process it is attaching to does not match the current exec&ndash;file loaded by GDB, the option exec&ndash;file&ndash;mismatch specifies how to handle the mismatch. GDB tries to compare the files by comparing their build IDs (see build ID), if available.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set exec-file-mismatch_0"><b>set exec-file-mismatch</b></a> &lsquo;ask|warn|off&rsquo;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Whether to detect mismatch between the current executable file loaded by GDB and the executable file used to start the process. If &lsquo;ask&rsquo;, the default, display a warning and ask the user whether to load the process executable file; if &lsquo;warn&rsquo;, just display a warning; if &lsquo;off&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t attempt to detect a mismatch. If the user confirms loading the process executable file, then its symbols will be loaded as well.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show exec-file-mismatch_0"><b>show exec-file-mismatch</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current value of exec&ndash;file&ndash;mismatch.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The first thing GDB does after arranging to debug the specified process is to stop it. You can examine and modify an attached process with all the GDB commands that are ordinarily available when you start processes with run. You can insert breakpoints; you can step and continue; you can modify storage. If you would rather the process continue running, you may use the continue command after attaching GDB to the process.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_detach_0"><b>detach</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When you have finished debugging the attached process, you can use the detach command to release it from GDB control. Detaching the process continues its execution. After the detach command, that process and GDB become completely independent once more, and you are ready to attach another process or start one with run. detach does not repeat if you press RET again after executing the command.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If you exit GDB while you have an attached process, you detach that process. If you use the run command, you kill that process. By default, GDB asks for confirmation if you try to do either of these things; you can control whether or not you need to confirm by using the set confirm command (see Optional Warnings and Messages).
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_5b4c339e" href="#TOC_HEAD_5b4c339e">4.8 Killing the Child Process</a></H2>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_kill_0"><b>kill</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Kill the child process in which your program is running under GDB.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	This command is useful if you wish to debug a core dump instead of a running process. GDB ignores any core dump file while your program is running.
</p>
<p>
	On some operating systems, a program cannot be executed outside GDB while you have breakpoints set on it inside GDB. You can use the kill command in this situation to permit running your program outside the debugger.
</p>
<p>
	The kill command is also useful if you wish to recompile and relink your program, since on many systems it is impossible to modify an executable file while it is running in a process. In this case, when you next type run, GDB notices that the file has changed, and reads the symbol table again (while trying to preserve your current breakpoint settings).

<p>
	GDB lets you run and debug multiple programs in a single session. In addition, GDB on some systems may let you run several programs simultaneously (otherwise you have to exit from one before starting another). On some systems GDB may even let you debug several programs simultaneously on different remote systems. In the most general case, you can have multiple threads of execution in each of multiple processes, launched from multiple executables, running on different machines.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="HEAD_HIDDEN_cf0be816">GDB represents the state of each program execution with an object called an <a name="wd_ln_inferior_0" target="_blank" href="../tags/inferior.html"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>inferior</a> .  &nbsp;<a href="../tags/inferior.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>inferior</a></li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	An inferior typically corresponds to a process, but is more general and applies also to targets that do not have processes. Inferiors may be created before a process runs, and may be retained after a process exits. Inferiors have unique identifiers that are different from process ids. Usually each inferior will also have its own distinct address space, although some embedded targets may have several inferiors running in different parts of a single address space. Each inferior may in turn have multiple threads running in it.
</p>
<p>
	The commands info inferiors and info connections, which will be introduced below, accept a space&ndash;separated ID list as their argument specifying one or more elements on which to operate. A list element can be either a single non&ndash;negative number, like &lsquo;5&rsquo;, or an ascending range of such numbers, like &lsquo;5&ndash;7&rsquo;. A list can consist of any combination of such elements, even duplicates or overlapping ranges are valid. E.g. &lsquo;1 4&ndash;6 5 4&ndash;4&rsquo; or &lsquo;1 2 4&ndash;7&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
	To find out what inferiors exist at any moment, use info inferiors:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info inferiors_0"><b>info inferiors</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print a list of all inferiors currently being managed by GDB. By default all inferiors are printed, but the ID list id&hellip; can be used to limit the display to just the requested inferiors.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB displays for each inferior (in this order):
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>the inferior number assigned by GDB</li>
		<li>the target system&rsquo;s inferior identifier</li>
		<li>the target connection the inferior is bound to, including the unique connection number assigned by GDB, and the protocol used by the connection.</li>
		<li>the name of the executable the inferior is running.</li>
		<br />
	</ol>
	<p>
		An asterisk &lsquo;*&rsquo; preceding the GDB inferior number indicates the current inferior.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example,
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info inferiors
Num  Description       Connection                      Executable
* 1    process 3401      1 (native)                      goodbye
2    process 2307      2 (extended-remote host:10000)  hello	</code></pre>
</ul>
<p>
	To get information about the current inferior, use inferior:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_inferior_1" target="_blank" href="../tags/inferior.html"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>inferior</a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Shows information about the current inferior.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example,
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) inferior
[Current inferior is 1 [process 3401] (helloworld)]	</code></pre>
</ul>
<p>
	To find out what open target connections exist at any moment, use info connections:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info connections_0"><b>info connections</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print a list of all open target connections currently being managed by GDB. By default all connections are printed, but the ID list id&hellip; can be used to limit the display to just the requested connections.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB displays for each connection (in this order):
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>the connection number assigned by GDB.</li>
		<li>the protocol used by the connection.</li>
		<li>a textual description of the protocol used by the connection.</li>
		<br />
	</ol>
	<p>
		An asterisk &lsquo;*&rsquo; preceding the connection number indicates the connection of the current inferior.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example,
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info connections
Num  What                        Description
* 1    extended-remote host:10000  Extended remote serial target in gdb-specific protocol
2    native                      Native process
3    core                        Local core dump file	</code></pre>
</ul>
<p>
	To switch focus between inferiors, use the inferior command:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_inferior infno_0"><b>inferior infno</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Make inferior number infno the current inferior. The argument infno is the inferior number assigned by GDB, as shown in the first field of the &lsquo;info inferiors&rsquo; display.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The debugger convenience variable &lsquo;$_inferior&rsquo; contains the number of the current inferior. You may find this useful in writing breakpoint conditional expressions, command scripts, and so forth. See Convenience Variables, for general information on convenience variables.
</p>
<p>
	You can get multiple executables into a debugging session via the add&ndash;inferior and clone&ndash;inferior commands. On some systems GDB can add inferiors to the debug session automatically by following calls to fork and exec. To remove inferiors from the debugging session use the remove&ndash;inferiors command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_add-inferior_0"><b>add-inferior</b></a> [ &ndash;copies n ] [ &ndash;exec executable ] [&ndash;no&ndash;connection ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Adds n inferiors to be run using executable as the executable; n defaults to 1. If no executable is specified, the inferiors begins empty, with no program. You can still assign or change the program assigned to the inferior at any time by using the file command with the executable name as its argument.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, the new inferior begins connected to the same target connection as the current inferior. For example, if the current inferior was connected to gdbserver with target remote, then the new inferior will be connected to the same gdbserver instance. The &lsquo;&ndash;no&ndash;connection&rsquo; option starts the new inferior with no connection yet. You can then for example use the target remote command to connect to some other gdbserver instance, use run to spawn a local program, etc.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_clone-inferior_0"><b>clone-inferior</b></a> [ &ndash;copies n ] [ infno ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Adds n inferiors ready to execute the same program as inferior infno; n defaults to 1, and infno defaults to the number of the current inferior. This command copies the values of the args, inferior&ndash;tty and cwd properties from the current inferior to the new one. It also propagates changes the user made to environment variables using the set environment and unset environment commands. This is a convenient command when you want to run another instance of the inferior you are debugging.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info inferiors
Num  Description       Connection   Executable
* 1    process 29964     1 (native)   helloworld
(gdb) clone-inferior
Added inferior 2.
1 inferiors added.
(gdb) info inferiors
Num  Description       Connection   Executable
* 1    process 29964     1 (native)   helloworld
2    &lt;null&gt;            1 (native)   helloworld	</code></pre>
	<p>
		You can now simply switch focus to inferior 2 and run it.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_remove-inferiors_0"><b>remove-inferiors</b></a> infno&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Removes the inferior or inferiors infno&hellip;. It is not possible to remove an inferior that is running with this command. For those, use the kill or detach command first.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	To quit debugging one of the running inferiors that is not the current inferior, you can either detach from it by using the detach inferior command (allowing it to run independently), or kill it using the kill inferiors command:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_detach inferior_0"><b>detach inferior</b></a> infno&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Detach from the inferior or inferiors identified by GDB inferior number(s) infno&hellip;. Note that the inferior&rsquo;s entry still stays on the list of inferiors shown by info inferiors, but its Description will show &lsquo;&lt;null&gt;&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_kill inferiors_0"><b>kill inferiors</b></a> infno&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Kill the inferior or inferiors identified by GDB inferior number(s) infno&hellip;. Note that the inferior&rsquo;s entry still stays on the list of inferiors shown by info inferiors, but its Description will show &lsquo;&lt;null&gt;&rsquo;.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	After the successful completion of a command such as detach, detach inferiors, kill or kill inferiors, or after a normal process exit, the inferior is still valid and listed with info inferiors, ready to be restarted.
</p>
<p>
	To be notified when inferiors are started or exit under GDB&rsquo;s control use set print inferior&ndash;events:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set print inferior-events_0"><b>set print inferior-events</b></a></li>
	<li>set print inferior&ndash;events on</li>
	<li>set print inferior&ndash;events off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The set print inferior&ndash;events command allows you to enable or disable printing of messages when GDB notices that new inferiors have started or that inferiors have exited or have been detached. By default, these messages will be printed.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show print inferior-events_0"><b>show print inferior-events</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether messages will be printed when GDB detects that inferiors have started, exited or have been detached.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Many commands will work the same with multiple programs as with a single program: e.g., print myglobal will simply display the value of myglobal in the current inferior.
</p>
<p>
	Occasionally, when debugging GDB itself, it may be useful to get more info about the relationship of inferiors, programs, address spaces in a debug session. You can do that with the maint info program&ndash;spaces command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_maint info_0"><b>maint info</b></a> program&ndash;spaces</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print a list of all program spaces currently being managed by GDB.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB displays for each program space (in this order):
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>the program space number assigned by GDB</li>
		<li>the name of the executable loaded into the program space, with e.g., the file command.</li>
		<li>the name of the core file loaded into the program space, with e.g., the core&ndash;file command.</li>
		<br />
	</ol>
	<p>
		An asterisk &lsquo;*&rsquo; preceding the GDB program space number indicates the current program space.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, below each program space line, GDB prints extra information that isn&rsquo;t suitable to display in tabular form. For example, the list of inferiors bound to the program space.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) maint info program-spaces
Id   Executable        Core File
* 1    hello
2    goodbye
        Bound inferiors: ID 1 (process 21561)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Here we can see that no inferior is running the program hello, while process 21561 is running the program goodbye. On some targets, it is possible that multiple inferiors are bound to the same program space. The most common example is that of debugging both the parent and child processes of a vfork call. For example,
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) maint info program-spaces
Id   Executable        Core File
* 1    vfork-test
        Bound inferiors: ID 2 (process 18050), ID 1 (process 18045)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Here, both inferior 2 and inferior 1 are running in the same program space as a result of inferior 1 having executed a vfork call.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_4985249b" href="#TOC_HEAD_4985249b">4.10 Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads</a></H2>
<p>
	In some operating systems, such as GNU/Linux and Solaris, a single program may have more than one thread of execution. The precise semantics of threads differ from one operating system to another, but in general the threads of a single program are akin to multiple processes&mdash;except that they share one address space (that is, they can all examine and modify the same variables). On the other hand, each thread has its own registers and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.
</p>
<p>
	GDB provides these facilities for debugging multi&ndash;thread programs:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>automatic notification of new threads</li>
	<li>&lsquo;thread thread&ndash;id&rsquo;, a command to switch among threads</li>
	<li>&lsquo;info threads&rsquo;, a command to inquire about existing threads</li>
	<li>&lsquo;thread apply [thread&ndash;id&ndash;list | all] args&rsquo;, a command to apply a command to a list of threads</li>
	<li>thread&ndash;specific breakpoints</li>
	<li>&lsquo;set print thread&ndash;events&rsquo;, which controls printing of messages on thread start and exit.</li>
	<li>&lsquo;set libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path path&rsquo;, which lets the user specify which libthread_db to use if the default choice isn&rsquo;t compatible with the program.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	The GDB thread debugging facility allows you to observe all threads while your program runs&mdash;but whenever GDB takes control, one thread in particular is always the focus of debugging. This thread is called the current thread. Debugging commands show program information from the perspective of the current thread.
</p>
<p>
	Whenever GDB detects a new thread in your program, it displays the target system&rsquo;s identification for the thread with a message in the form &lsquo;[New systag]&rsquo;, where systag is a thread identifier whose form varies depending on the particular system. For example, on GNU/Linux, you might see
</p>
<pre><code>[New Thread 0x41e02940 (LWP 25582)]</code></pre>
<p>
	when GDB notices a new thread. In contrast, on other systems, the systag is simply something like &lsquo;process 368&rsquo;, with no further qualifier.
</p>
<p>
	For debugging purposes, GDB associates its own thread number &mdash;always a single integer&mdash;with each thread of an inferior. This number is unique between all threads of an inferior, but not unique between threads of different inferiors.
</p>
<p>
	You can refer to a given thread in an inferior using the qualified inferior&ndash;num.thread&ndash;num syntax, also known as qualified thread ID, with inferior&ndash;num being the inferior number and thread&ndash;num being the thread number of the given inferior. For example, thread 2.3 refers to thread number 3 of inferior 2. If you omit inferior&ndash;num (e.g., thread 3), then GDB infers you&rsquo;re referring to a thread of the current inferior.
</p>
<p>
	Until you create a second inferior, GDB does not show the inferior&ndash;num part of thread IDs, even though you can always use the full inferior&ndash;num.thread&ndash;num form to refer to threads of inferior 1, the initial inferior.
</p>
<p>
	Some commands accept a space&ndash;separated thread ID list as argument. A list element can be:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>A thread ID as shown in the first field of the &lsquo;info threads&rsquo; display, with or without an inferior qualifier. E.g., &lsquo;2.1&rsquo; or &lsquo;1&rsquo;.</li>
	<li>A range of thread numbers, again with or without an inferior qualifier, as in inf.thr1&ndash;thr2 or thr1&ndash;thr2. E.g., &lsquo;1.2&ndash;4&rsquo; or &lsquo;2&ndash;4&rsquo;.</li>
	<li>All threads of an inferior, specified with a star wildcard, with or without an inferior qualifier, as in inf.* (e.g., &lsquo;1.*&rsquo;) or *. The former refers to all threads of the given inferior, and the latter form without an inferior qualifier refers to all threads of the current inferior.</li>
	<br />
</ol>
<p>
	For example, if the current inferior is 1, and inferior 7 has one thread with ID 7.1, the thread list &lsquo;1 2&ndash;3 4.5 6.7&ndash;9 7.*&rsquo; includes threads 1 to 3 of inferior 1, thread 5 of inferior 4, threads 7 to 9 of inferior 6 and all threads of inferior 7. That is, in expanded qualified form, the same as &lsquo;1.1 1.2 1.3 4.5 6.7 6.8 6.9 7.1&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to a per&ndash;inferior number, each thread is also assigned a unique global number, also known as global thread ID, a single integer. Unlike the thread number component of the thread ID, no two threads have the same global ID, even when you&rsquo;re debugging multiple inferiors.
</p>
<p>
	From GDB&rsquo;s perspective, a process always has at least one thread. In other words, GDB assigns a thread number to the program&rsquo;s &ldquo;main thread&rdquo; even if the program is not multi&ndash;threaded.
</p>
<p>
	The debugger convenience variables &lsquo;$_thread&rsquo; and &lsquo;$_gthread&rsquo; contain, respectively, the per&ndash;inferior thread number and the global thread number of the current thread. You may find this useful in writing breakpoint conditional expressions, command scripts, and so forth. The convenience variable &lsquo;$_inferior_thread_count&rsquo; contains the number of live threads in the current inferior. See Convenience Variables, for general information on convenience variables.
</p>
<p>
	When running in non&ndash;stop mode (see Non&ndash;Stop Mode), where new threads can be created, and existing threads exit, at any time, &lsquo;$_inferior_thread_count&rsquo; could return a different value each time it is evaluated.
</p>
<p>
	If GDB detects the program is multi&ndash;threaded, it augments the usual message about stopping at a breakpoint with the ID and name of the thread that hit the breakpoint.
</p>
<pre><code>Thread 2 "client" hit Breakpoint 1, send_message () at client.c:68</code></pre>
<p>
	Likewise when the program receives a signal:
</p>
<pre><code>Thread 1 "main" received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.</code></pre>
<ul>
	<li>info threads [&ndash;gid] [thread&ndash;id&ndash;list]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display information about one or more threads. With no arguments displays information about all threads. You can specify the list of threads that you want to display using the thread ID list syntax (see thread ID lists).
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB displays for each thread (in this order):
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>the per&ndash;inferior thread number assigned by GDB</li>
		<li>the global thread number assigned by GDB, if the &lsquo;&ndash;gid&rsquo; option was specified</li>
		<li>the target system&rsquo;s thread identifier (systag)</li>
		<li>the thread&rsquo;s name, if one is known. A thread can either be named by the user (see thread name, below), or, in some cases, by the program itself.</li>
		<li>the current stack frame summary for that thread</li>
		<br />
	</ol>
	<p>
		An asterisk &lsquo;*&rsquo; to the left of the GDB thread number indicates the current thread.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example,
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info threads
Id   Target Id             Frame
* 1    process 35 thread 13  main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
2    process 35 thread 23  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
3    process 35 thread 27  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
    at threadtest.c:68	</code></pre>
</ul>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;re debugging multiple inferiors, GDB displays thread IDs using the qualified inferior&ndash;num.thread&ndash;num format. Otherwise, only thread&ndash;num is shown.
</p>
<p>
	If you specify the &lsquo;&ndash;gid&rsquo; option, GDB displays a column indicating each thread&rsquo;s global thread ID:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info threads
Id   GId  Target Id             Frame
1.1  1    process 35 thread 13  main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
1.2  3    process 35 thread 23  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
1.3  4    process 35 thread 27  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
* 2.1  2    process 65 thread 1   main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)</code></pre>
<p>
	On Solaris, you can display more information about user threads with a Solaris&ndash;specific command:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_maint info sol-threads_0"><b>maint info sol-threads</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display info on Solaris user threads.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_thread_0"><b>thread</b></a> thread&ndash;id</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Make thread ID thread&ndash;id the current thread. The command argument thread&ndash;id is the GDB thread ID, as shown in the first field of the &lsquo;info threads&rsquo; display, with or without an inferior qualifier (e.g., &lsquo;2.1&rsquo; or &lsquo;1&rsquo;).
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB responds by displaying the system identifier of the thread you selected, and its current stack frame summary:
	</p>
	<p>
		(gdb) thread 2
		[Switching to thread 2 (Thread 0xb7fdab70 (LWP 12747))]
		#0  some_function (ignore=0x0) at example.c:8
		8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    printf (&quot;hello\n&quot;);
	</p>
	<p>
		As with the &lsquo;[New &hellip;]&rsquo; message, the form of the text after &lsquo;Switching to&rsquo; depends on your system&rsquo;s conventions for identifying threads.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_thread apply_0"><b>thread apply</b></a> [thread&ndash;id&ndash;list | all [&ndash;ascending]] [flag]&hellip; command</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The thread apply command allows you to apply the named command to one or more threads. Specify the threads that you want affected using the thread ID list syntax (see thread ID lists), or specify all to apply to all threads. To apply a command to all threads in descending order, type thread apply all command. To apply a command to all threads in ascending order, type thread apply all &ndash;ascending command.
	</p>
	<p>
		The flag arguments control what output to produce and how to handle errors raised when applying command to a thread. flag must start with a &ndash; directly followed by one letter in qcs. If several flags are provided, they must be given individually, such as &ndash;c &ndash;q.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, GDB displays some thread information before the output produced by command, and an error raised during the execution of a command will abort thread apply. The following flags can be used to fine&ndash;tune this behavior:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&ndash;c</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The flag &ndash;c, which stands for &lsquo;continue&rsquo;, causes any errors in command to be displayed, and the execution of thread apply then continues.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;s</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The flag &ndash;s, which stands for &lsquo;silent&rsquo;, causes any errors or empty output produced by a command to be silently ignored. That is, the execution continues, but the thread information and errors are not printed.
			&ndash;q
		</p>
		<p>
			The flag &ndash;q (&lsquo;quiet&rsquo;) disables printing the thread information.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Flags &ndash;c and &ndash;s cannot be used together.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_taas_0"><b>taas</b></a> [option]&hellip; command</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Shortcut for thread apply all &ndash;s [option]&hellip; command. Applies command on all threads, ignoring errors and empty output.
	</p>
	<p>

	<p>
		Shortcut for thread apply all &ndash;s &ndash;&ndash; frame apply all &ndash;s [option]&hellip; command. Applies command on all frames of all threads, ignoring errors and empty output. Note that the flag &ndash;s is specified twice: The first &ndash;s ensures that thread apply only shows the thread information of the threads for which frame apply produces some output. The second &ndash;s is needed to ensure that frame apply shows the frame information of a frame only if the command successfully produced some output.
	</p>
	<p>
		It can for example be used to print a local variable or a function argument without knowing the thread or frame where this variable or argument is, using:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) tfaas p some_local_var_i_do_not_remember_where_it_is	</code></pre>
	<p>

	<li><a name="wd_ln_thread name_0"><b>thread name</b></a> [name]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command assigns a name to the current thread. If no argument is given, any existing user&ndash;specified name is removed. The thread name appears in the &lsquo;info threads&rsquo; display.
	</p>
	<p>
		On some systems, such as GNU/Linux, GDB is able to determine the name of the thread as given by the OS. On these systems, a name specified with &lsquo;thread name&rsquo; will override the system&ndash;give name, and removing the user&ndash;specified name will cause GDB to once again display the system&ndash;specified name.

	</p>
	<p>
		As well as being the complement to the &lsquo;thread name&rsquo; command, this command also allows you to identify a thread by its target systag. For instance, on GNU/Linux, the target systag is the LWP id.
	</p>
	<p>
		(gdb) thread find 26688
		Thread 4 has target id &#039;Thread 0x41e02940 (LWP 26688)&#039;

	<br />
	<p>
		If this variable is set, path is a colon&ndash;separated list of directories GDB will use to search for libthread_db. If you omit path, &lsquo;libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; will be reset to its default value ($sdir:$pdir on GNU/Linux and Solaris systems). Internally, the default value comes from the LIBTHREAD_DB_SEARCH_PATH macro.
	</p>
	<p>
		On GNU/Linux and Solaris systems, GDB uses a &ldquo;helper&rdquo; libthread_db library to obtain information about threads in the inferior process. GDB will use &lsquo;libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; to find libthread_db. GDB also consults first if inferior specific thread debugging library loading is enabled by &lsquo;set auto&ndash;load libthread&ndash;db&rsquo; (see libthread_db.so.1 file).
	</p>
	<p>
		A special entry &lsquo;$sdir&rsquo; for &lsquo;libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; refers to the default system directories that are normally searched for loading shared libraries. The &lsquo;$sdir&rsquo; entry is the only kind not needing to be enabled by &lsquo;set auto&ndash;load libthread&ndash;db&rsquo; (see libthread_db.so.1 file).
	</p>
	<p>
		A special entry &lsquo;$pdir&rsquo; for &lsquo;libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; refers to the directory from which libpthread was loaded in the inferior process.
	</p>
	<p>
		For any libthread_db library GDB finds in above directories, GDB attempts to initialize it with the current inferior process. If this initialization fails (which could happen because of a version mismatch between libthread_db and libpthread), GDB will unload libthread_db, and continue with the next directory. If none of libthread_db libraries initialize successfully, GDB will issue a warning and thread debugging will be disabled.

	<H2><a name="HEAD_38f939f9" href="#TOC_HEAD_38f939f9">4.11 Debugging Forks</a></H2>
<p>
	On most systems, GDB has no special support for debugging programs which create additional processes using the fork function. When a program forks, GDB will continue to debug the parent process and the child process will run unimpeded. If you have set a breakpoint in any code which the child then executes, the child will get a SIGTRAP signal which (unless it catches the signal) will cause it to terminate.
</p>
<p>
	However, if you want to debug the child process there is a workaround which isn&rsquo;t too painful. Put a call to sleep in the code which the child process executes after the fork. It may be useful to sleep only if a certain environment variable is set, or a certain file exists, so that the delay need not occur when you don&rsquo;t want to run GDB on the child. While the child is sleeping, use the ps program to get its process ID. Then tell GDB (a new invocation of GDB if you are also debugging the parent process) to attach to the child process (see Attach). From that point on you can debug the child process just like any other process which you attached to.
</p>
<p>
	On some systems, GDB provides support for debugging programs that create additional processes using the fork or vfork functions. On GNU/Linux platforms, this feature is supported with kernel version 2.5.46 and later.
</p>
<p>
	The fork debugging commands are supported in native mode and when connected to gdbserver in either target remote mode or target extended&ndash;remote mode.
</p>
<p>
	By default, when a program forks, GDB will continue to debug the parent process and the child process will run unimpeded.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to follow the child process instead of the parent process, use the command set follow&ndash;fork&ndash;mode.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set follow-fork-mode_0"><b>set follow-fork-mode</b></a> mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the debugger response to a program call of fork or vfork. A call to fork or vfork creates a new process. The mode argument can be:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>parent</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The original process is debugged after a fork. The child process runs unimpeded. This is the default.
		</p>
		<li>child</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The new process is debugged after a fork. The parent process runs unimpeded.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show follow-fork-mode_0"><b>show follow-fork-mode</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current debugger response to a fork or vfork call.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	On Linux, if you want to debug both the parent and child processes, use the command set detach&ndash;on&ndash;fork.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set detach-on-fork_0"><b>set detach-on-fork</b></a> mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tells gdb whether to detach one of the processes after a fork, or retain debugger control over them both.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>on</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The child process (or parent process, depending on the value of follow&ndash;fork&ndash;mode) will be detached and allowed to run independently. This is the default.
		</p>
		<li>off</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Both processes will be held under the control of GDB. One process (child or parent, depending on the value of follow&ndash;fork&ndash;mode) is debugged as usual, while the other is held suspended.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show detach-on-fork_0"><b>show detach-on-fork</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether detach&ndash;on&ndash;fork mode is on/off.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If you choose to set &lsquo;detach&ndash;on&ndash;fork&rsquo; mode off, then GDB will retain control of all forked processes (including nested forks). You can list the forked processes under the control of GDB by using the info inferiors command, and switch from one fork to another by using the inferior command (see Debugging Multiple Inferiors Connections and Programs).
</p>
<p>
	To quit debugging one of the forked processes, you can either detach from it by using the detach inferiors command (allowing it to run independently), or kill it using the kill inferiors command. See Debugging Multiple Inferiors Connections and Programs.
</p>
<p>
	If you ask to debug a child process and a vfork is followed by an exec, GDB executes the new target up to the first breakpoint in the new target. If you have a breakpoint set on main in your original program, the breakpoint will also be set on the child process&rsquo;s main.
</p>
<p>
	On some systems, when a child process is spawned by vfork, you cannot debug the child or parent until an exec call completes.
</p>
<p>
	If you issue a run command to GDB after an exec call executes, the new target restarts. To restart the parent process, use the file command with the parent executable name as its argument. By default, after an exec call executes, GDB discards the symbols of the previous executable image. You can change this behaviour with the set follow&ndash;exec&ndash;mode command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set follow-exec-mode_0"><b>set follow-exec-mode</b></a> mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set debugger response to a program call of exec. An exec call replaces the program image of a process.
	</p>
	<p>
		follow&ndash;exec&ndash;mode can be:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>new</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			GDB creates a new inferior and rebinds the process to this new inferior. The program the process was running before the exec call can be restarted afterwards by restarting the original inferior.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) info inferiors
(gdb) info inferior
Id   Description   Executable
* 1    &lt;null&gt;        prog1
(gdb) run
process 12020 is executing new program: prog2
Program exited normally.
(gdb) info inferiors
Id   Description   Executable
1    &lt;null&gt;        prog1
* 2    &lt;null&gt;        prog2		</code></pre>
		<li>same</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			GDB keeps the process bound to the same inferior. The new executable image replaces the previous executable loaded in the inferior. Restarting the inferior after the exec call, with e.g., the run command, restarts the executable the process was running after the exec call. This is the default mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) info inferiors
Id   Description   Executable
* 1    &lt;null&gt;        prog1
(gdb) run
process 12020 is executing new program: prog2
Program exited normally.
(gdb) info inferiors
Id   Description   Executable
* 1    &lt;null&gt;        prog2		</code></pre>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	follow&ndash;exec&ndash;mode is supported in native mode and target extended&ndash;remote mode.
</p>
<p>
	You can use the catch command to make GDB stop whenever a fork, vfork, or exec call is made. See Setting Catchpoints.

</menu>

</div>
<p>
	On certain operating systems4, GDB is able to save a snapshot of a program&rsquo;s state, called a checkpoint, and come back to it later.
</p>
<p>
	Returning to a checkpoint effectively undoes everything that has happened in the program since the checkpoint was saved. This includes changes in memory, registers, and even (within some limits) system state. Effectively, it is like going back in time to the moment when the checkpoint was saved.
</p>
<p>
	Thus, if you&rsquo;re stepping thru a program and you think you&rsquo;re getting close to the point where things go wrong, you can save a checkpoint. Then, if you accidentally go too far and miss the critical statement, instead of having to restart your program from the beginning, you can just go back to the checkpoint and start again from there.
</p>
<p>
	This can be especially useful if it takes a lot of time or steps to reach the point where you think the bug occurs.
</p>
<p>
	To use the checkpoint/restart method of debugging:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_checkpoint_0"><b>checkpoint</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Save a snapshot of the debugged program&rsquo;s current execution state. The checkpoint command takes no arguments, but each checkpoint is assigned a small integer id, similar to a breakpoint id.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info checkpoints_0"><b>info checkpoints</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		List the checkpoints that have been saved in the current debugging session. For each checkpoint, the following information will be listed:
	</p>
	<pre><code>Checkpoint ID
Process ID
Code Address
Source line, or label	</code></pre>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_restart_0"><b>restart</b></a> checkpoint&ndash;id</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Restore the program state that was saved as checkpoint number checkpoint&ndash;id. All program variables, registers, stack frames etc. will be returned to the values that they had when the checkpoint was saved. In essence, gdb will &ldquo;wind back the clock&rdquo; to the point in time when the checkpoint was saved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that breakpoints, GDB variables, command history etc. are not affected by restoring a checkpoint. In general, a checkpoint only restores things that reside in the program being debugged, not in the debugger.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_delete checkpoint_0"><b>delete checkpoint</b></a> checkpoint&ndash;id</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Delete the previously&ndash;saved checkpoint identified by checkpoint&ndash;id.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Returning to a previously saved checkpoint will restore the user state of the program being debugged, plus a significant subset of the system (OS) state, including file pointers. It won&rsquo;t &ldquo;un&ndash;write&rdquo; data from a file, but it will rewind the file pointer to the previous location, so that the previously written data can be overwritten. For files opened in read mode, the pointer will also be restored so that the previously read data can be read again.
</p>
<p>
	Of course, characters that have been sent to a printer (or other external device) cannot be &ldquo;snatched back&rdquo;, and characters received from eg. a serial device can be removed from internal program buffers, but they cannot be &ldquo;pushed back&rdquo; into the serial pipeline, ready to be received again. Similarly, the actual contents of files that have been changed cannot be restored (at this time).
</p>
<p>
	However, within those constraints, you actually can &ldquo;rewind&rdquo; your program to a previously saved point in time, and begin debugging it again &mdash; and you can change the course of events so as to debug a different execution path this time.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, there is one bit of internal program state that will be different when you return to a checkpoint &mdash; the program&rsquo;s process id. Each checkpoint will have a unique process id (or pid), and each will be different from the program&rsquo;s original pid. If your program has saved a local copy of its process id, this could potentially pose a problem.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_7ce43029" href="#TOC_HEAD_7ce43029">4.12.1 A Non&ndash;obvious Benefit of Using Checkpoints</a></H3>
<p>
	On some systems such as GNU/Linux, address space randomization is performed on new processes for security reasons. This makes it difficult or impossible to set a breakpoint, or watchpoint, on an absolute address if you have to restart the program, since the absolute location of a symbol will change from one execution to the next.
</p>
<p>
	A checkpoint, however, is an identical copy of a process. Therefore if you create a checkpoint at (eg.) the start of main, and simply return to that checkpoint instead of restarting the process, you can avoid the effects of address randomization and your symbols will all stay in the same place.

<p>
	The principal purposes of using a debugger are so that you can stop your program before it terminates; or so that, if your program runs into trouble, you can investigate and find out why.
</p>
<p>
	Inside GDB, your program may stop for any of several reasons, such as a signal, a breakpoint, or reaching a new line after a GDB command such as step. You may then examine and change variables, set new breakpoints or remove old ones, and then continue execution. Usually, the messages shown by GDB provide ample explanation of the status of your program&mdash;but you can also explicitly request this information at any time.

<p>
	A breakpoint makes your program stop whenever a certain point in the program is reached. For each breakpoint, you can add conditions to control in finer detail whether your program stops. You can set breakpoints with the break command and its variants (see Setting Breakpoints), to specify the place where your program should stop by line number, function name or exact address in the program.
</p>
<p>
	On some systems, you can set breakpoints in shared libraries before the executable is run.
</p>
<p>
	A watchpoint is a special breakpoint that stops your program when the value of an expression changes. The expression may be a value of a variable, or it could involve values of one or more variables combined by operators, such as &lsquo;a + b&rsquo;. This is sometimes called data breakpoints. You must use a different command to set watchpoints (see Setting Watchpoints), but aside from that, you can manage a watchpoint like any other breakpoint: you enable, disable, and delete both breakpoints and watchpoints using the same commands.
</p>
<p>
	You can arrange to have values from your program displayed automatically whenever GDB stops at a breakpoint. See Automatic Display.
</p>
<p>
	A catchpoint is another special breakpoint that stops your program when a certain kind of event occurs, such as the throwing of a C++ exception or the loading of a library. As with watchpoints, you use a different command to set a catchpoint (see Setting Catchpoints), but aside from that, you can manage a catchpoint like any other breakpoint. (To stop when your program receives a signal, use the handle command; see Signals.)
</p>
<p>
	GDB assigns a number to each breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint when you create it; these numbers are successive integers starting with one. In many of the commands for controlling various features of breakpoints you use the breakpoint number to say which breakpoint you want to change. Each breakpoint may be enabled or disabled; if disabled, it has no effect on your program until you enable it again.
</p>
<p>
	Some GDB commands accept a space&ndash;separated list of breakpoints on which to operate. A list element can be either a single breakpoint number, like &lsquo;5&rsquo;, or a range of such numbers, like &lsquo;5&ndash;7&rsquo;. When a breakpoint list is given to a command, all breakpoints in that list are operated on.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_2007316d" href="#TOC_HEAD_2007316d">5.1.1 Setting Breakpoints</a></H3>
<p>
	Breakpoints are set with the break command (abbreviated b). The debugger convenience variable &lsquo;$bpnum&rsquo; records the number of the breakpoint you&rsquo;ve set most recently:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) b main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x11c6: file zeoes.c, line 24.
(gdb) p $bpnum
$1 = 1</code></pre>
<p>
	A breakpoint may be mapped to multiple code locations for example with inlined functions, Ada generics, C++ templates or overloaded function names. GDB then indicates the number of code locations in the breakpoint command output:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) b some_func
Breakpoint 2 at 0x1179: some_func. (3 locations)
(gdb) p $bpnum
$2 = 2
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	When your program stops on a breakpoint, the convenience variables &lsquo;$_hit_bpnum&rsquo; and &lsquo;$_hit_locno&rsquo; are respectively set to the number of the encountered breakpoint and the number of the breakpoint&rsquo;s code location:
</p>
<pre><code>Thread 1 "zeoes" hit Breakpoint 2.1, some_func () at zeoes.c:8
8	  printf("some func\n");
(gdb) p $_hit_bpnum
$5 = 2
(gdb) p $_hit_locno
$6 = 1
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	Note that &lsquo;$_hit_bpnum&rsquo; and &lsquo;$bpnum&rsquo; are not equivalent: &lsquo;$_hit_bpnum&rsquo; is set to the breakpoint number last hit, while &lsquo;$bpnum&rsquo; is set to the breakpoint number last set.
</p>
<p>
	If the encountered breakpoint has only one code location, &lsquo;$_hit_locno&rsquo; is set to 1:
</p>
<pre><code>Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe018) at zeoes.c:24
24	  if (argc &gt; 1)
(gdb) p $_hit_bpnum
$3 = 1
(gdb) p $_hit_locno
$4 = 1
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	The &lsquo;$_hit_bpnum&rsquo; and &lsquo;$_hit_locno&rsquo; variables can typically be used in a breakpoint command list. (see Breakpoint Command Lists). For example, as part of the breakpoint command list, you can disable completely the encountered breakpoint using disable $_hit_bpnum or disable the specific encountered breakpoint location using disable $_hit_bpnum.$_hit_locno. If a breakpoint has only one location, &lsquo;$_hit_locno&rsquo; is set to 1 and the commands disable $_hit_bpnum and disable $_hit_bpnum.$_hit_locno both disable the breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
	You can also define aliases to easily disable the last hit location or last hit breakpoint:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias lld = disable $_hit_bpnum.$_hit_locno
(gdb) alias lbd = disable $_hit_bpnum</code></pre>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_break_0"><b>break</b></a> locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a breakpoint at all the code locations in your program that result from resolving the given locspec. locspec can specify a function name, a line number, an address of an instruction, and more. See Location Specifications, for the various forms of locspec. The breakpoint will stop your program just before it executes the instruction at the address of any of the breakpoint&rsquo;s code locations.
	</p>
	<p>
		When using source languages that permit overloading of symbols, such as C++, a function name may refer to more than one symbol, and thus more than one place to break. See Ambiguous Expressions, for a discussion of that situation.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is also possible to insert a breakpoint that will stop the program only if a specific thread (see Thread&ndash;Specific Breakpoints) or a specific task (see Ada Tasks) hits that breakpoint.
	</p>
	<li>break</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When called without any arguments, break sets a breakpoint at the next instruction to be executed in the selected stack frame (see Examining the Stack). In any selected frame but the innermost, this makes your program stop as soon as control returns to that frame. This is similar to the effect of a finish command in the frame inside the selected frame&mdash;except that finish does not leave an active breakpoint. If you use break without an argument in the innermost frame, GDB stops the next time it reaches the current location; this may be useful inside loops.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB normally ignores breakpoints when it resumes execution, until at least one instruction has been executed. If it did not do this, you would be unable to proceed past a breakpoint without first disabling the breakpoint. This rule applies whether or not the breakpoint already existed when your program stopped.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	<a name="wd_ln_break if_0"><b> break if</b></a> cond
</p>
<pre><code>Set a breakpoint with condition cond; evaluate the expression cond each time the breakpoint is reached, and stop only if the value is nonzero—that is, if cond evaluates as true. ‘…’ stands for one of the possible arguments described above (or no argument) specifying where to break. See Break Conditions, for more information on breakpoint conditions.

The breakpoint may be mapped to multiple locations. If the breakpoint condition cond is invalid at some but not all of the locations, the locations for which the condition is invalid are disabled. For example, GDB reports below that two of the three locations are disabled.

    (gdb) break func if a == 10
    warning: failed to validate condition at location 0x11ce, disabling:
    No symbol "a" in current context.
    warning: failed to validate condition at location 0x11b6, disabling:
    No symbol "a" in current context.
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x11b6: func. (3 locations)

Locations that are disabled because of the condition are denoted by an uppercase N in the output of the info breakpoints command:

    (gdb) info breakpoints
    Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
    1       breakpoint     keep y   &lt;MULTIPLE&gt;
            stop only if a == 10
    1.1                         N*  0x00000000000011b6 in ...
    1.2                         y   0x00000000000011c2 in ...
    1.3                         N*  0x00000000000011ce in ...
    (*): Breakpoint condition is invalid at this location.

If the breakpoint condition cond is invalid in the context of all the locations of the breakpoint, GDB refuses to define the breakpoint. For example, if variable foo is an undefined variable:

    (gdb) break func if foo
    No symbol "foo" in current context.</code></pre>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_break -force-condition_0"><b>break -force-condition</b></a> if cond</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		There may be cases where the condition cond is invalid at all the current locations, but the user knows that it will be valid at a future location; for example, because of a library load. In such cases, by using the &ndash;force&ndash;condition keyword before &lsquo;if&rsquo;, GDB can be forced to define the breakpoint with the given condition expression instead of refusing it.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) break func -force-condition if foo
warning: failed to validate condition at location 1, disabling:
No symbol "foo" in current context.
warning: failed to validate condition at location 2, disabling:
No symbol "foo" in current context.
warning: failed to validate condition at location 3, disabling:
No symbol "foo" in current context.
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1158: test.c:18. (3 locations)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This causes all the present locations where the breakpoint would otherwise be inserted, to be disabled, as seen in the example above. However, if there exist locations at which the condition is valid, the &ndash;force&ndash;condition keyword has no effect.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_tbreak_0"><b>tbreak</b></a> args</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a breakpoint enabled only for one stop. The args are the same as for the break command, and the breakpoint is set in the same way, but the breakpoint is automatically deleted after the first time your program stops there. See Disabling Breakpoints.

	<br />
	<p>
		Set a hardware&ndash;assisted breakpoint. The args are the same as for the break command and the breakpoint is set in the same way, but the breakpoint requires hardware support and some target hardware may not have this support. The main purpose of this is EPROM/ROM code debugging, so you can set a breakpoint at an instruction without changing the instruction. This can be used with the new trap&ndash;generation provided by SPARClite DSU and most x86&ndash;based targets. These targets will generate traps when a program accesses some data or instruction address that is assigned to the debug registers. However the hardware breakpoint registers can take a limited number of breakpoints. For example, on the DSU, only two data breakpoints can be set at a time, and GDB will reject this command if more than two are used. Delete or disable unused hardware breakpoints before setting new ones (see Disabling Breakpoints). See Break Conditions. For remote targets, you can restrict the number of hardware breakpoints GDB will use, see set remote hardware&ndash;breakpoint&ndash;limit.

	<li><a name="wd_ln_rbreak_0"><b>rbreak</b></a> regex</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set breakpoints on all functions matching the regular expression regex. This command sets an unconditional breakpoint on all matches, printing a list of all breakpoints it set. Once these breakpoints are set, they are treated just like the breakpoints set with the break command. You can delete them, disable them, or make them conditional the same way as any other breakpoint.
	</p>
	<p>
		In programs using different languages, GDB chooses the syntax to print the list of all breakpoints it sets according to the &lsquo;set language&rsquo; value: using &lsquo;set language auto&rsquo; (see Set Language Automatically) means to use the language of the breakpoint&rsquo;s function, other values mean to use the manually specified language (see Set Language Manually).
	</p>
	<p>
		The syntax of the regular expression is the standard one used with tools like grep. Note that this is different from the syntax used by shells, so for instance foo* matches all functions that include an fo followed by zero or more os. There is an implicit .* leading and trailing the regular expression you supply, so to match only functions that begin with foo, use &circ;foo.
	</p>
	<p>
		When debugging C++ programs, rbreak is useful for setting breakpoints on overloaded functions that are not members of any special classes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rbreak command can be used to set breakpoints in all the functions in a program, like this:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) rbreak .	</code></pre>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_rbreak_1"><b>rbreak</b></a> file:regex</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If rbreak is called with a filename qualification, it limits the search for functions matching the given regular expression to the specified file. This can be used, for example, to set breakpoints on every function in a given file:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) rbreak file.c:.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The colon separating the filename qualifier from the regex may optionally be surrounded by spaces.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info breakpoints_0"><b>info breakpoints</b></a> [list&hellip;]</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info break_0"><b>info break</b></a> [list&hellip;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print a table of all breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints set and not deleted. Optional argument n means print information only about the specified breakpoint(s) (or watchpoint(s) or catchpoint(s)). For each breakpoint, following columns are printed:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Breakpoint Numbers</li>
		<li>Type</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint.
		</p>
		<li>Disposition</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Whether the breakpoint is marked to be disabled or deleted when hit.
		</p>
		<li>Enabled or Disabled</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Enabled breakpoints are marked with &lsquo;y&rsquo;. &lsquo;n&rsquo; marks breakpoints that are not enabled.
		</p>
		<li>Address</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Where the breakpoint is in your program, as a memory address. For a pending breakpoint whose address is not yet known, this field will contain &lsquo;&lt;PENDING&gt;&rsquo;. Such breakpoint won&rsquo;t fire until a shared library that has the symbol or line referred by breakpoint is loaded. See below for details. A breakpoint with several locations will have &lsquo;&lt;MULTIPLE&gt;&rsquo; in this field&mdash;see below for details.
		</p>
		<li>What</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Where the breakpoint is in the source for your program, as a file and line number. For a pending breakpoint, the original string passed to the breakpoint command will be listed as it cannot be resolved until the appropriate shared library is loaded in the future.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If a breakpoint is conditional, there are two evaluation modes: &ldquo;host&rdquo; and &ldquo;target&rdquo;. If mode is &ldquo;host&rdquo;, breakpoint condition evaluation is done by GDB on the host&rsquo;s side. If it is &ldquo;target&rdquo;, then the condition is evaluated by the target. The info break command shows the condition on the line following the affected breakpoint, together with its condition evaluation mode in between parentheses.
	</p>
	<p>
		Breakpoint commands, if any, are listed after that. A pending breakpoint is allowed to have a condition specified for it. The condition is not parsed for validity until a shared library is loaded that allows the pending breakpoint to resolve to a valid location.
	</p>
	<p>
		info break with a breakpoint number n as argument lists only that breakpoint. The convenience variable $_ and the default examining&ndash;address for the x command are set to the address of the last breakpoint listed (see Examining Memory).
	</p>
	<p>
		info break displays a count of the number of times the breakpoint has been hit. This is especially useful in conjunction with the ignore command. You can ignore a large number of breakpoint hits, look at the breakpoint info to see how many times the breakpoint was hit, and then run again, ignoring one less than that number. This will get you quickly to the last hit of that breakpoint.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a breakpoints with an enable count (xref) greater than 1, info break also displays that count.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	GDB allows you to set any number of breakpoints at the same place in your program. There is nothing silly or meaningless about this. When the breakpoints are conditional, this is even useful (see Break Conditions).
</p>
<p>
	It is possible that a single logical breakpoint is set at several code locations in your program. See Location Specifications, for examples.
</p>
<p>
	A breakpoint with multiple code locations is displayed in the breakpoint table using several rows&mdash;one header row, followed by one row for each code location. The header row has &lsquo;&lt;MULTIPLE&gt;&rsquo; in the address column. Each code location row contains the actual address, source file, source line and function of its code location. The number column for a code location is of the form breakpoint&ndash;number.location&ndash;number.
</p>
<p>
	For example:
</p>
<pre><code>Num     Type           Disp Enb  Address    What
1       breakpoint     keep y    &lt;MULTIPLE&gt;
        stop only if i==1
        breakpoint already hit 1 time
1.1                         y    0x080486a2 in void foo&lt;int&gt;() at t.cc:8
1.2                         y    0x080486ca in void foo&lt;double&gt;() at t.cc:8</code></pre>
<p>
	You cannot delete the individual locations from a breakpoint. However, each location can be individually enabled or disabled by passing breakpoint&ndash;number.location&ndash;number as argument to the enable and disable commands. It&rsquo;s also possible to enable and disable a range of location&ndash;number locations using a breakpoint&ndash;number and two location&ndash;numbers, in increasing order, separated by a hyphen, like breakpoint&ndash;number.location&ndash;number1&ndash;location&ndash;number2, in which case GDB acts on all the locations in the range (inclusive). Disabling or enabling the parent breakpoint (see Disabling) affects all of the locations that belong to that breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
	Locations that are enabled while their parent breakpoint is disabled won&rsquo;t trigger a break, and are denoted by y&ndash; in the Enb column. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info breakpoints
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep n   &lt;MULTIPLE&gt;
1.1                         y-  0x00000000000011b6 in ...
1.2                         y-  0x00000000000011c2 in ...
1.3                         n   0x00000000000011ce in ...</code></pre>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s quite common to have a breakpoint inside a shared library. Shared libraries can be loaded and unloaded explicitly, and possibly repeatedly, as the program is executed. To support this use case, GDB updates breakpoint locations whenever any shared library is loaded or unloaded. Typically, you would set a breakpoint in a shared library at the beginning of your debugging session, when the library is not loaded, and when the symbols from the library are not available. When you try to set breakpoint, GDB will ask you if you want to set a so called pending breakpoint&mdash;breakpoint whose address is not yet resolved.
</p>
<p>
	After the program is run, whenever a new shared library is loaded, GDB reevaluates all the breakpoints. When a newly loaded shared library contains the symbol or line referred to by some pending breakpoint, that breakpoint is resolved and becomes an ordinary breakpoint. When a library is unloaded, all breakpoints that refer to its symbols or source lines become pending again.
</p>
<p>
	This logic works for breakpoints with multiple locations, too. For example, if you have a breakpoint in a C++ template function, and a newly loaded shared library has an instantiation of that template, a new location is added to the list of locations for the breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
	Except for having unresolved address, pending breakpoints do not differ from regular breakpoints. You can set conditions or commands, enable and disable them and perform other breakpoint operations.
</p>
<p>
	GDB provides some additional commands for controlling what happens when the &lsquo;break&rsquo; command cannot resolve the location spec to any code location in your program (see Location Specifications):
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint pending_0"><b>set breakpoint pending</b></a> auto</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is the default behavior. When GDB cannot resolve the location spec, it queries you whether a pending breakpoint should be created.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint pending_1"><b>set breakpoint pending</b></a> on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This indicates that when GDB cannot resolve the location spec, it should create a pending breakpoint without confirmation.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint pending_2"><b>set breakpoint pending</b></a> off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This indicates that pending breakpoints are not to be created. If GDB cannot resolve the location spec, it aborts the breakpoint creation with an error. This setting does not affect any pending breakpoints previously created.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show breakpoint pending_0"><b>show breakpoint pending</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current behavior setting for creating pending breakpoints.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The settings above only affect the break command and its variants. Once a breakpoint is set, it will be automatically updated as shared libraries are loaded and unloaded.
</p>
<p>
	For some targets, GDB can automatically decide if hardware or software breakpoints should be used, depending on whether the breakpoint address is read&ndash;only or read&ndash;write. This applies to breakpoints set with the break command as well as to internal breakpoints set by commands like next and finish. For breakpoints set with hbreak, GDB will always use hardware breakpoints.
</p>
<p>
	You can control this automatic behaviour with the following commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint auto-hw_0"><b>set breakpoint auto-hw</b></a> on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is the default behavior. When GDB sets a breakpoint, it will try to use the target memory map to decide if software or hardware breakpoint must be used.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint auto-hw_1"><b>set breakpoint auto-hw</b></a> off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This indicates GDB should not automatically select breakpoint type. If the target provides a memory map, GDB will warn when trying to set software breakpoint at a read&ndash;only address.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	GDB normally implements breakpoints by replacing the program code at the breakpoint address with a special instruction, which, when executed, given control to the debugger. By default, the program code is so modified only when the program is resumed. As soon as the program stops, GDB restores the original instructions. This behaviour guards against leaving breakpoints inserted in the target should gdb abrubptly disconnect. However, with slow remote targets, inserting and removing breakpoint can reduce the performance. This behavior can be controlled with the following commands::
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint always-inserted_0"><b>set breakpoint always-inserted</b></a> off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		All breakpoints, including newly added by the user, are inserted in the target only when the target is resumed. All breakpoints are removed from the target when it stops. This is the default mode.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint always-inserted_1"><b>set breakpoint always-inserted</b></a> on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Causes all breakpoints to be inserted in the target at all times. If the user adds a new breakpoint, or changes an existing breakpoint, the breakpoints in the target are updated immediately. A breakpoint is removed from the target only when breakpoint itself is deleted.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	GDB handles conditional breakpoints by evaluating these conditions when a breakpoint breaks. If the condition is true, then the process being debugged stops, otherwise the process is resumed.
</p>
<p>
	If the target supports evaluating conditions on its end, GDB may download the breakpoint, together with its conditions, to it.
</p>
<p>
	This feature can be controlled via the following commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint condition-evaluation host_0"><b>set breakpoint condition-evaluation host</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This option commands GDB to evaluate the breakpoint conditions on the host&rsquo;s side. Unconditional breakpoints are sent to the target which in turn receives the triggers and reports them back to GDB for condition evaluation. This is the standard evaluation mode.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint condition-evaluation target_0"><b>set breakpoint condition-evaluation target</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This option commands GDB to download breakpoint conditions to the target at the moment of their insertion. The target is responsible for evaluating the conditional expression and reporting breakpoint stop events back to GDB whenever the condition is true. Due to limitations of target&ndash;side evaluation, some conditions cannot be evaluated there, e.g., conditions that depend on local data that is only known to the host. Examples include conditional expressions involving convenience variables, complex types that cannot be handled by the agent expression parser and expressions that are too long to be sent over to the target, specially when the target is a remote system. In these cases, the conditions will be evaluated by GDB.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set breakpoint condition-evaluation auto_0"><b>set breakpoint condition-evaluation auto</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is the default mode. If the target supports evaluating breakpoint conditions on its end, GDB will download breakpoint conditions to the target (limitations mentioned previously apply). If the target does not support breakpoint condition evaluation, then GDB will fallback to evaluating all these conditions on the host&rsquo;s side.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	GDB itself sometimes sets breakpoints in your program for special purposes, such as proper handling of longjmp (in C programs). These internal breakpoints are assigned negative numbers, starting with &ndash;1; &lsquo;info breakpoints&rsquo; does not display them. You can see these breakpoints with the GDB maintenance command &lsquo;maint info breakpoints&rsquo; (see maint info breakpoints).
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_b9476be" href="#TOC_HEAD_b9476be">5.1.2 Setting Watchpoints</a></H3>
<p>
	You can use a watchpoint to stop execution whenever the value of an expression changes, without having to predict a particular place where this may happen. (This is sometimes called a data breakpoint.) The expression may be as simple as the value of a single variable, or as complex as many variables combined by operators. Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A reference to the value of a single variable.</li>
	<li>An address cast to an appropriate data type. For example, &lsquo;*(int *)0x12345678&rsquo; will watch a 4&ndash;byte region at the specified address (assuming an int occupies 4 bytes).</li>
	<li>An arbitrarily complex expression, such as &lsquo;a*b + c/d&rsquo;. The expression can use any operators valid in the program&rsquo;s native language (see Languages).</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	You can set a watchpoint on an expression even if the expression can not be evaluated yet. For instance, you can set a watchpoint on &lsquo;*global_ptr&rsquo; before &lsquo;global_ptr&rsquo; is initialized. GDB will stop when your program sets &lsquo;global_ptr&rsquo; and the expression produces a valid value. If the expression becomes valid in some other way than changing a variable (e.g. if the memory pointed to by &lsquo;*global_ptr&rsquo; becomes readable as the result of a malloc call), GDB may not stop until the next time the expression changes.
</p>
<p>
	Depending on your system, watchpoints may be implemented in software or hardware. GDB does software watchpointing by single&ndash;stepping your program and testing the variable&rsquo;s value each time, which is hundreds of times slower than normal execution. (But this may still be worth it, to catch errors where you have no clue what part of your program is the culprit.)
</p>
<p>
	On some systems, such as most PowerPC or x86&ndash;based targets, GDB includes support for hardware watchpoints, which do not slow down the running of your program.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_watch_0"><b>watch</b></a> [&ndash;l|&ndash;location] expr [thread thread&ndash;id] [mask maskvalue] [task task&ndash;id]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a watchpoint for an expression. GDB will break when the expression expr is written into by the program and its value changes. The simplest (and the most popular) use of this command is to watch the value of a single variable:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) watch foo	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If the command includes a [thread thread&ndash;id] argument, GDB breaks only when the thread identified by thread&ndash;id changes the value of expr. If any other threads change the value of expr, GDB will not break. Note that watchpoints restricted to a single thread in this way only work with Hardware Watchpoints.
	</p>
	<p>
		Similarly, if the task argument is given, then the watchpoint will be specific to the indicated Ada task (see Ada Tasks).
	</p>
	<p>
		Ordinarily a watchpoint respects the scope of variables in expr (see below). The &ndash;location argument tells GDB to instead watch the memory referred to by expr. In this case, GDB will evaluate expr, take the address of the result, and watch the memory at that address. The type of the result is used to determine the size of the watched memory. If the expression&rsquo;s result does not have an address, then GDB will print an error.
	</p>
	<p>
		The [mask maskvalue] argument allows creation of masked watchpoints, if the current architecture supports this feature (e.g., PowerPC Embedded architecture, see PowerPC Embedded.) A masked watchpoint specifies a mask in addition to an address to watch. The mask specifies that some bits of an address (the bits which are reset in the mask) should be ignored when matching the address accessed by the inferior against the watchpoint address. Thus, a masked watchpoint watches many addresses simultaneously&mdash;those addresses whose unmasked bits are identical to the unmasked bits in the watchpoint address. The mask argument implies &ndash;location. Examples:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) watch foo mask 0xffff00ff
(gdb) watch *0xdeadbeef mask 0xffffff00	</code></pre>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_rwatch_0"><b>rwatch</b></a> [&ndash;l|&ndash;location] expr [thread thread&ndash;id] [mask maskvalue]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a watchpoint that will break when the value of expr is read by the program.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_awatch_0"><b>awatch</b></a> [&ndash;l|&ndash;location] expr [thread thread&ndash;id] [mask maskvalue]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a watchpoint that will break when expr is either read from or written into by the program.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info watchpoints_0"><b>info watchpoints</b></a> [list&hellip;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command prints a list of watchpoints, using the same format as info break (see Set Breaks).
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If you watch for a change in a numerically entered address you need to dereference it, as the address itself is just a constant number which will never change. GDB refuses to create a watchpoint that watches a never&ndash;changing value:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) watch 0x600850
Cannot watch constant value 0x600850.
(gdb) watch *(int *) 0x600850
Watchpoint 1: *(int *) 6293584</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB sets a hardware watchpoint if possible. Hardware watchpoints execute very quickly, and the debugger reports a change in value at the exact instruction where the change occurs. If GDB cannot set a hardware watchpoint, it sets a software watchpoint, which executes more slowly and reports the change in value at the next statement, not the instruction, after the change occurs.
</p>
<p>
	You can force GDB to use only software watchpoints with the set can&ndash;use&ndash;hw&ndash;watchpoints 0 command. With this variable set to zero, GDB will never try to use hardware watchpoints, even if the underlying system supports them. (Note that hardware&ndash;assisted watchpoints that were set before setting can&ndash;use&ndash;hw&ndash;watchpoints to zero will still use the hardware mechanism of watching expression values.)
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set can-use-hw-watchpoints_0"><b>set can-use-hw-watchpoints</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set whether or not to use hardware watchpoints.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show can-use-hw-watchpoints_0"><b>show can-use-hw-watchpoints</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current mode of using hardware watchpoints.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	For remote targets, you can restrict the number of hardware watchpoints GDB will use, see set remote hardware&ndash;breakpoint&ndash;limit.
</p>
<p>
	When you issue the watch command, GDB reports
</p>
<pre><code>Hardware watchpoint num: expr</code></pre>
<p>
	if it was able to set a hardware watchpoint.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, the awatch and rwatch commands can only set hardware watchpoints, because accesses to data that don&rsquo;t change the value of the watched expression cannot be detected without examining every instruction as it is being executed, and GDB does not do that currently. If GDB finds that it is unable to set a hardware breakpoint with the awatch or rwatch command, it will print a message like this:
</p>
<pre><code>Expression cannot be implemented with read/access watchpoint.</code></pre>
<p>
	Sometimes, GDB cannot set a hardware watchpoint because the data type of the watched expression is wider than what a hardware watchpoint on the target machine can handle. For example, some systems can only watch regions that are up to 4 bytes wide; on such systems you cannot set hardware watchpoints for an expression that yields a double&ndash;precision floating&ndash;point number (which is typically 8 bytes wide). As a work&ndash;around, it might be possible to break the large region into a series of smaller ones and watch them with separate watchpoints.
</p>
<p>
	If you set too many hardware watchpoints, GDB might be unable to insert all of them when you resume the execution of your program. Since the precise number of active watchpoints is unknown until such time as the program is about to be resumed, GDB might not be able to warn you about this when you set the watchpoints, and the warning will be printed only when the program is resumed:
</p>
<p>
	Hardware watchpoint num: Could not insert watchpoint
</p>
<p>
	If this happens, delete or disable some of the watchpoints.
</p>
<p>
	Watching complex expressions that reference many variables can also exhaust the resources available for hardware&ndash;assisted watchpoints. That&rsquo;s because GDB needs to watch every variable in the expression with separately allocated resources.
</p>
<p>
	If you call a function interactively using print or call, any watchpoints you have set will be inactive until GDB reaches another kind of breakpoint or the call completes.
</p>
<p>
	GDB automatically deletes watchpoints that watch local (automatic) variables, or expressions that involve such variables, when they go out of scope, that is, when the execution leaves the block in which these variables were defined. In particular, when the program being debugged terminates, all local variables go out of scope, and so only watchpoints that watch global variables remain set. If you rerun the program, you will need to set all such watchpoints again. One way of doing that would be to set a code breakpoint at the entry to the main function and when it breaks, set all the watchpoints.
</p>
<p>
	In multi&ndash;threaded programs, watchpoints will detect changes to the watched expression from every thread.
</p>
<pre><code>Warning: In multi-threaded programs, software watchpoints have only limited usefulness. If GDB creates a software watchpoint, it can only watch the value of an expression in a single thread. If you are confident that the expression can only change due to the current thread’s activity (and if you are also confident that no other thread can become current), then you can use software watchpoints as usual. However, GDB may not notice when a non-current thread’s activity changes the expression. (Hardware watchpoints, in contrast, watch an expression in all threads.)</code></pre>

	<H3><a name="HEAD_764f752b" href="#TOC_HEAD_764f752b">5.1.3 Setting Catchpoints</a></H3>
<p>
	You can use catchpoints to cause the debugger to stop for certain kinds of program events, such as C++ exceptions or the loading of a shared library. Use the catch command to set a catchpoint.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>catch event</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Stop when event occurs. The event can be any of the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>throw [regexp]</li>
		<li>rethrow [regexp]</li>
		<li>catch [regexp]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The throwing, re&ndash;throwing, or catching of a C++ exception.
		</p>
		<p>
			If regexp is given, then only exceptions whose type matches the regular expression will be caught.
		</p>
		<p>
			The convenience variable $_exception is available at an exception&ndash;related catchpoint, on some systems. This holds the exception being thrown.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are currently some limitations to C++ exception handling in GDB:
		</p>
		<pre><code>The support for these commands is system-dependent. Currently, only systems using the ‘gnu-v3’ C++ ABI (see ABI) are supported.
The regular expression feature and the $_exception convenience variable rely on the presence of some SDT probes in libstdc++. If these probes are not present, then these features cannot be used. These probes were first available in the GCC 4.8 release, but whether or not they are available in your GCC also depends on how it was built.
The $_exception convenience variable is only valid at the instruction at which an exception-related catchpoint is set.
When an exception-related catchpoint is hit, GDB stops at a location in the system library which implements runtime exception support for C++, usually libstdc++. You can use up (see Selection) to get to your code.
If you call a function interactively, GDB normally returns control to you when the function has finished executing. If the call raises an exception, however, the call may bypass the mechanism that returns control to you and cause your program either to abort or to simply continue running until it hits a breakpoint, catches a signal that GDB is listening for, or exits. This is the case even if you set a catchpoint for the exception; catchpoints on exceptions are disabled within interactive calls. See Calling, for information on controlling this with set unwind-on-terminating-exception.
You cannot raise an exception interactively.
You cannot install an exception handler interactively.		</code></pre>
		<li>exception [name]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			An Ada exception being raised. If an exception name is specified at the end of the command (eg catch exception Program_Error), the debugger will stop only when this specific exception is raised. Otherwise, the debugger stops execution when any Ada exception is raised.
		</p>
		<p>
			When inserting an exception catchpoint on a user&ndash;defined exception whose name is identical to one of the exceptions defined by the language, the fully qualified name must be used as the exception name. Otherwise, GDB will assume that it should stop on the pre&ndash;defined exception rather than the user&ndash;defined one. For instance, assuming an exception called Constraint_Error is defined in package Pck, then the command to use to catch such exceptions is catch exception Pck.Constraint_Error.
		</p>
		<p>
			The convenience variable $_ada_exception holds the address of the exception being thrown. This can be useful when setting a condition for such a catchpoint.
		</p>
		<li>exception unhandled</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			An exception that was raised but is not handled by the program. The convenience variable $_ada_exception is set as for catch exception.
		</p>
		<li>handlers [name]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			An Ada exception being handled. If an exception name is specified at the end of the command (eg catch handlers Program_Error), the debugger will stop only when this specific exception is handled. Otherwise, the debugger stops execution when any Ada exception is handled.
		</p>
		<p>
			When inserting a handlers catchpoint on a user&ndash;defined exception whose name is identical to one of the exceptions defined by the language, the fully qualified name must be used as the exception name. Otherwise, GDB will assume that it should stop on the pre&ndash;defined exception rather than the user&ndash;defined one. For instance, assuming an exception called Constraint_Error is defined in package Pck, then the command to use to catch such exceptions handling is catch handlers Pck.Constraint_Error.
		</p>
		<p>
			The convenience variable $_ada_exception is set as for catch exception.
		</p>
		<li>assert</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			A failed Ada assertion. Note that the convenience variable $_ada_exception is not set by this catchpoint.
		</p>
		<li>exec</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			A call to exec.
		</p>
		<li>syscall</li>
		<li>syscall [name | number | group:groupname | g:groupname] &hellip;</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			A call to or return from a system call, a.k.a. syscall. A syscall is a mechanism for application programs to request a service from the operating system (OS) or one of the OS system services. GDB can catch some or all of the syscalls issued by the debuggee, and show the related information for each syscall. If no argument is specified, calls to and returns from all system calls will be caught.
		</p>
		<p>
			name can be any system call name that is valid for the underlying OS. Just what syscalls are valid depends on the OS. On GNU and Unix systems, you can find the full list of valid syscall names on /usr/include/asm/unistd.h.
		</p>
		<p>
			Normally, GDB knows in advance which syscalls are valid for each OS, so you can use the GDB command&ndash;line completion facilities (see command completion) to list the available choices.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may also specify the system call numerically. A syscall&rsquo;s number is the value passed to the OS&rsquo;s syscall dispatcher to identify the requested service. When you specify the syscall by its name, GDB uses its database of syscalls to convert the name into the corresponding numeric code, but using the number directly may be useful if GDB&rsquo;s database does not have the complete list of syscalls on your system (e.g., because GDB lags behind the OS upgrades).
		</p>
		<p>
			You may specify a group of related syscalls to be caught at once using the group: syntax (g: is a shorter equivalent). For instance, on some platforms GDB allows you to catch all network related syscalls, by passing the argument group:network to catch syscall. Note that not all syscall groups are available in every system. You can use the command completion facilities (see command completion) to list the syscall groups available on your environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			The example below illustrates how this command works if you don&rsquo;t provide arguments to it:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) catch syscall
Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
(gdb) r
Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall

Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'close'), \
    0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall 'close'), \
    0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb)		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Here is an example of catching a system call by name:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) catch syscall chroot
Catchpoint 1 (syscall 'chroot' [61])
(gdb) r
Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall

Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'chroot'), \
        0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall 'chroot'), \
    0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb)		</code></pre>
		<p>
			An example of specifying a system call numerically. In the case below, the syscall number has a corresponding entry in the XML file, so GDB finds its name and prints it:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) catch syscall 252
Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) 'exit_group')
(gdb) r
Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall

Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'exit_group'), \
        0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Program exited normally.
(gdb)		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Here is an example of catching a syscall group:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) catch syscall group:process
Catchpoint 1 (syscalls 'exit' [1] 'fork' [2] 'waitpid' [7]
'execve' [11] 'wait4' [114] 'clone' [120] 'vfork' [190]
'exit_group' [252] 'waitid' [284] 'unshare' [310])
(gdb) r
Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall

Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall fork), 0x00007ffff7df4e27 in open64 ()
from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

(gdb) c
Continuing.		</code></pre>
		<p>
			However, there can be situations when there is no corresponding name in XML file for that syscall number. In this case, GDB prints a warning message saying that it was not able to find the syscall name, but the catchpoint will be set anyway. See the example below:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) catch syscall 764
warning: The number '764' does not represent a known syscall.
Catchpoint 2 (syscall 764)
(gdb)		</code></pre>
		<p>
			If you configure GDB using the &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;without&ndash;expat&rsquo; option, it will not be able to display syscall names. Also, if your architecture does not have an XML file describing its system calls, you will not be able to see the syscall names. It is important to notice that these two features are used for accessing the syscall name database. In either case, you will see a warning like this:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) catch syscall
warning: Could not open "syscalls/i386-linux.xml"
warning: Could not load the syscall XML file 'syscalls/i386-linux.xml'.
GDB will not be able to display syscall names.
Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
(gdb)		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Of course, the file name will change depending on your architecture and system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Still using the example above, you can also try to catch a syscall by its number. In this case, you would see something like:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) catch syscall 252
Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) 252)		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Again, in this case GDB would not be able to display syscall&rsquo;s names.
		</p>
		<li>fork</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			A call to fork.
		</p>
		<li>vfork</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			A call to vfork.
		</p>
		<li>load [regexp]</li>
		<li>unload [regexp]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The loading or unloading of a shared library. If regexp is given, then the catchpoint will stop only if the regular expression matches one of the affected libraries.
		</p>
		<li>signal [signal&hellip; | &lsquo;all&rsquo;]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The delivery of a signal.
		</p>
		<p>
			With no arguments, this catchpoint will catch any signal that is not used internally by GDB, specifically, all signals except &lsquo;SIGTRAP&rsquo; and &lsquo;SIGINT&rsquo;.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the argument &lsquo;all&rsquo;, all signals, including those used by GDB, will be caught. This argument cannot be used with other signal names.
		</p>
		<p>
			Otherwise, the arguments are a list of signal names as given to handle (see Signals). Only signals specified in this list will be caught.
		</p>
		<p>
			One reason that catch signal can be more useful than handle is that you can attach commands and conditions to the catchpoint.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a signal is caught by a catchpoint, the signal&rsquo;s stop and print settings, as specified by handle, are ignored. However, whether the signal is still delivered to the inferior depends on the pass setting; this can be changed in the catchpoint&rsquo;s commands.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li>tcatch event</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a catchpoint that is enabled only for one stop. The catchpoint is automatically deleted after the first time the event is caught.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Use the info break command to list the current catchpoints.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_f9e3708c" href="#TOC_HEAD_f9e3708c">5.1.4 Deleting Breakpoints</a></H3>
<p>
	It is often necessary to eliminate a breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint once it has done its job and you no longer want your program to stop there. This is called deleting the breakpoint. A breakpoint that has been deleted no longer exists; it is forgotten.
</p>
<p>
	With the clear command you can delete breakpoints according to where they are in your program. With the delete command you can delete individual breakpoints, watchpoints, or catchpoints by specifying their breakpoint numbers.
</p>
<p>
	It is not necessary to delete a breakpoint to proceed past it. GDB automatically ignores breakpoints on the first instruction to be executed when you continue execution without changing the execution address.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_clear_0"><b>clear</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Delete any breakpoints at the next instruction to be executed in the selected stack frame (see Selecting a Frame). When the innermost frame is selected, this is a good way to delete a breakpoint where your program just stopped.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_clear_1"><b>clear</b></a> locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Delete any breakpoint with a code location that corresponds to locspec. See Location Specifications, for the various forms of locspec. Which code locations correspond to locspec depends on the form used in the location specification locspec:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>linenum</li>
		<li>filename:linenum</li>
		<li>&ndash;line linenum</li>
		<li>&ndash;source filename &ndash;line linenum</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			If locspec specifies a line number, with or without a file name, the command deletes any breakpoint with a code location that is at or within the specified line linenum in files that match the specified filename. If filename is omitted, it defaults to the current source file.
		</p>
		<li>*address</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			If locspec specifies an address, the command deletes any breakpoint with a code location that is at the given address.
		</p>
		<li>function</li>
		<li>&ndash;function function</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			If locspec specifies a function, the command deletes any breakpoint with a code location that is at the entry to any function whose name matches function.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Ambiguity in names of files and functions can be resolved as described in Location Specifications.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_delete_0"><b>delete</b></a> [breakpoints] [list&hellip;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Delete the breakpoints, watchpoints, or catchpoints of the breakpoint list specified as argument. If no argument is specified, delete all breakpoints (GDB asks confirmation, unless you have set confirm off). You can abbreviate this command as d.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_f6961386" href="#TOC_HEAD_f6961386">5.1.5 Disabling Breakpoints</a></H3>
<p>
	Rather than deleting a breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint, you might prefer to disable it. This makes the breakpoint inoperative as if it had been deleted, but remembers the information on the breakpoint so that you can enable it again later.
</p>
<p>
	You disable and enable breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints with the enable and disable commands, optionally specifying one or more breakpoint numbers as arguments. Use info break to print a list of all breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints if you do not know which numbers to use.
</p>
<p>
	Disabling and enabling a breakpoint that has multiple locations affects all of its locations.
</p>
<p>
	A breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint can have any of several different states of enablement:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enabled. The breakpoint stops your program. A breakpoint set with the break command starts out in this state.</li>
	<li>Disabled. The breakpoint has no effect on your program.</li>
	<li>Enabled once. The breakpoint stops your program, but then becomes disabled.</li>
	<li>Enabled for a count. The breakpoint stops your program for the next N times, then becomes disabled.</li>
	<li>Enabled for deletion. The breakpoint stops your program, but immediately after it does so it is deleted permanently. A breakpoint set with the tbreak command starts out in this state.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	You can use the following commands to enable or disable breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_disable_0"><b>disable</b></a> [breakpoints] [list&hellip;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable the specified breakpoints&mdash;or all breakpoints, if none are listed. A disabled breakpoint has no effect but is not forgotten. All options such as ignore&ndash;counts, conditions and commands are remembered in case the breakpoint is enabled again later. You may abbreviate disable as dis.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_enable_0"><b>enable</b></a> [breakpoints] [list&hellip;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable the specified breakpoints (or all defined breakpoints). They become effective once again in stopping your program.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_enable_1"><b>enable</b></a> [breakpoints] once list&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily. GDB disables any of these breakpoints immediately after stopping your program.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_enable_2"><b>enable</b></a> [breakpoints] count count list&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily. GDB records count with each of the specified breakpoints, and decrements a breakpoint&rsquo;s count when it is hit. When any count reaches 0, GDB disables that breakpoint. If a breakpoint has an ignore count (see Break Conditions), that will be decremented to 0 before count is affected.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_enable_3"><b>enable</b></a> [breakpoints] delete list&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable the specified breakpoints to work once, then die. GDB deletes any of these breakpoints as soon as your program stops there. Breakpoints set by the tbreak command start out in this state.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Except for a breakpoint set with tbreak (see Setting Breakpoints), breakpoints that you set are initially enabled; subsequently, they become disabled or enabled only when you use one of the commands above. (The command until can set and delete a breakpoint of its own, but it does not change the state of your other breakpoints; see Continuing and Stepping.)
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_ae67dc59" href="#TOC_HEAD_ae67dc59">5.1.6 Break Conditions</a></H3>
<p>
	The simplest sort of breakpoint breaks every time your program reaches a specified place. You can also specify a condition for a breakpoint. A condition is just a Boolean expression in your programming language (see Expressions). A breakpoint with a condition evaluates the expression each time your program reaches it, and your program stops only if the condition is true.
</p>
<p>
	This is the converse of using assertions for program validation; in that situation, you want to stop when the assertion is violated&mdash;that is, when the condition is false. In C, if you want to test an assertion expressed by the condition assert, you should set the condition &lsquo;! assert&rsquo; on the appropriate breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
	Conditions are also accepted for watchpoints; you may not need them, since a watchpoint is inspecting the value of an expression anyhow&mdash;but it might be simpler, say, to just set a watchpoint on a variable name, and specify a condition that tests whether the new value is an interesting one.
</p>
<p>
	Break conditions can have side effects, and may even call functions in your program. This can be useful, for example, to activate functions that log program progress, or to use your own print functions to format special data structures. The effects are completely predictable unless there is another enabled breakpoint at the same address. (In that case, GDB might see the other breakpoint first and stop your program without checking the condition of this one.) Note that breakpoint commands are usually more convenient and flexible than break conditions for the purpose of performing side effects when a breakpoint is reached (see Breakpoint Command Lists).
</p>
<p>
	Breakpoint conditions can also be evaluated on the target&rsquo;s side if the target supports it. Instead of evaluating the conditions locally, GDB encodes the expression into an agent expression (see Agent Expressions) suitable for execution on the target, independently of GDB. Global variables become raw memory locations, locals become stack accesses, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
	In this case, GDB will only be notified of a breakpoint trigger when its condition evaluates to true. This mechanism may provide faster response times depending on the performance characteristics of the target since it does not need to keep GDB informed about every breakpoint trigger, even those with false conditions.
</p>
<p>
	Break conditions can be specified when a breakpoint is set, by using &lsquo;if&rsquo; in the arguments to the break command. See Setting Breakpoints. They can also be changed at any time with the condition command.
</p>
<p>
	You can also use the if keyword with the watch command. The catch command does not recognize the if keyword; condition is the only way to impose a further condition on a catchpoint.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_condition_0"><b>condition</b></a> bnum expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specify expression as the break condition for breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint number bnum. After you set a condition, breakpoint bnum stops your program only if the value of expression is true (nonzero, in C). When you use condition, GDB checks expression immediately for syntactic correctness, and to determine whether symbols in it have referents in the context of your breakpoint. If expression uses symbols not referenced in the context of the breakpoint, GDB prints an error message:
	</p>
	<pre><code>No symbol "foo" in current context.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		GDB does not actually evaluate expression at the time the condition command (or a command that sets a breakpoint with a condition, like break if &hellip;) is given, however. See Expressions.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_condition -force_0"><b>condition -force</b></a> bnum expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When the &ndash;force flag is used, define the condition even if expression is invalid at all the current locations of breakpoint bnum. This is similar to the &ndash;force&ndash;condition option of the break command.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_condition_1"><b>condition</b></a> bnum</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Remove the condition from breakpoint number bnum. It becomes an ordinary unconditional breakpoint.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	A special case of a breakpoint condition is to stop only when the breakpoint has been reached a certain number of times. This is so useful that there is a special way to do it, using the ignore count of the breakpoint. Every breakpoint has an ignore count, which is an integer. Most of the time, the ignore count is zero, and therefore has no effect. But if your program reaches a breakpoint whose ignore count is positive, then instead of stopping, it just decrements the ignore count by one and continues. As a result, if the ignore count value is n, the breakpoint does not stop the next n times your program reaches it.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_ignore_0"><b>ignore</b></a> bnum count</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the ignore count of breakpoint number bnum to count. The next count times the breakpoint is reached, your program&rsquo;s execution does not stop; other than to decrement the ignore count, GDB takes no action.
	</p>
	<p>
		To make the breakpoint stop the next time it is reached, specify a count of zero.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you use continue to resume execution of your program from a breakpoint, you can specify an ignore count directly as an argument to continue, rather than using ignore. See Continuing and Stepping.
	</p>
	<p>
		If a breakpoint has a positive ignore count and a condition, the condition is not checked. Once the ignore count reaches zero, GDB resumes checking the condition.
	</p>
	<p>
		You could achieve the effect of the ignore count with a condition such as &lsquo;$foo&ndash;&ndash; &lt;= 0&rsquo; using a debugger convenience variable that is decremented each time. See Convenience Variables.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Ignore counts apply to breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_981d1330" href="#TOC_HEAD_981d1330">5.1.7 Breakpoint Command Lists</a></H3>
<p>
	You can give any breakpoint (or watchpoint or catchpoint) a series of commands to execute when your program stops due to that breakpoint. For example, you might want to print the values of certain expressions, or enable other breakpoints.
</p>
<pre><code>commands [list…]
… command-list …
end

Specify a list of commands for the given breakpoints. The commands themselves appear on the following lines. Type a line containing just end to terminate the commands.

To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type commands and follow it immediately with end; that is, give no commands.

With no argument, commands refers to the last breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint set (not to the breakpoint most recently encountered). If the most recent breakpoints were set with a single command, then the commands will apply to all the breakpoints set by that command. This applies to breakpoints set by rbreak, and also applies when a single break command creates multiple breakpoints (see Ambiguous Expressions).</code></pre>
<p>
	Pressing RET as a means of repeating the last GDB command is disabled within a command&ndash;list.
</p>
<p>
	Inside a command list, you can use the command disable $_hit_bpnum to disable the encountered breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
	If your breakpoint has several code locations, the command disable $_hit_bpnum.$_hit_locno will disable the specific breakpoint code location encountered. If the breakpoint has only one location, this command will disable the encountered breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
	You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again. Simply use the continue command, or step, or any other command that resumes execution.
</p>
<p>
	Any other commands in the command list, after a command that resumes execution, are ignored. This is because any time you resume execution (even with a simple next or step), you may encounter another breakpoint&mdash;which could have its own command list, leading to ambiguities about which list to execute.
</p>
<p>
	If the first command you specify in a command list is silent, the usual message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed. This may be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific message and then continue. If none of the remaining commands print anything, you see no sign that the breakpoint was reached. silent is meaningful only at the beginning of a breakpoint command list.
</p>
<p>
	The commands echo, output, and printf allow you to print precisely controlled output, and are often useful in silent breakpoints. See Commands for Controlled Output.
</p>
<p>
	For example, here is how you could use breakpoint commands to print the value of x at entry to foo whenever x is positive.
</p>
<pre><code>break foo if x&gt;0
commands
silent
printf "x is %d\n",x
cont
end</code></pre>
<p>
	One application for breakpoint commands is to compensate for one bug so you can test for another. Put a breakpoint just after the erroneous line of code, give it a condition to detect the case in which something erroneous has been done, and give it commands to assign correct values to any variables that need them. End with the continue command so that your program does not stop, and start with the silent command so that no output is produced. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre><code>break 403
commands
silent
set x = y + 4
cont
end</code></pre>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_39e95df8" href="#TOC_HEAD_39e95df8">5.1.8 Dynamic Printf</a></H3>
<p>
	The dynamic printf command dprintf combines a breakpoint with formatted printing of your program&rsquo;s data to give you the effect of inserting printf calls into your program on&ndash;the&ndash;fly, without having to recompile it.
</p>
<p>
	In its most basic form, the output goes to the GDB console. However, you can set the variable dprintf&ndash;style for alternate handling. For instance, you can ask to format the output by calling your program&rsquo;s printf function. This has the advantage that the characters go to the program&rsquo;s output device, so they can recorded in redirects to files and so forth.
</p>
<p>
	If you are doing remote debugging with a stub or agent, you can also ask to have the printf handled by the remote agent. In addition to ensuring that the output goes to the remote program&rsquo;s device along with any other output the program might produce, you can also ask that the dprintf remain active even after disconnecting from the remote target. Using the stub/agent is also more efficient, as it can do everything without needing to communicate with GDB.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_dprintf_0"><b>dprintf</b></a> locspec,template,expression[,expression&hellip;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Whenever execution reaches a code location that results from resolving locspec, print the values of one or more expressions under the control of the string template. To print several values, separate them with commas.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set dprintf-style_0"><b>set dprintf-style</b></a> style</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the dprintf output to be handled in one of several different styles enumerated below. A change of style affects all existing dynamic printfs immediately. (If you need individual control over the print commands, simply define normal breakpoints with explicitly&ndash;supplied command lists.)
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>gdb</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Handle the output using the GDB printf command. When using this style, it is possible to use the &lsquo;%V&rsquo; format specifier (see %V Format Specifier).
		</p>
		<li>call</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Handle the output by calling a function in your program (normally printf). When using this style the supported format specifiers depend entirely on the function being called.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of GDB&rsquo;s format specifiers align with those supported by the printf function, however, GDB&rsquo;s &lsquo;%V&rsquo; format specifier extension is not supported by printf. When using &lsquo;call&rsquo; style dprintf, care should be taken to ensure that only format specifiers supported by the output function are used, otherwise the results will be undefined.
		</p>
		<li>agent</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Have the remote debugging agent (such as gdbserver) handle the output itself. This style is only available for agents that support running commands on the target. This style does not support the &lsquo;%V&rsquo; format specifier.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set dprintf-function_0"><b>set dprintf-function</b></a> function</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the function to call if the dprintf style is call. By default its value is printf. You may set it to any expression that GDB can evaluate to a function, as per the call command.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set dprintf-channel_0"><b>set dprintf-channel</b></a> channel</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a &ldquo;channel&rdquo; for dprintf. If set to a non&ndash;empty value, GDB will evaluate it as an expression and pass the result as a first argument to the dprintf&ndash;function, in the manner of fprintf and similar functions. Otherwise, the dprintf format string will be the first argument, in the manner of printf.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an example, if you wanted dprintf output to go to a logfile that is a standard I/O stream assigned to the variable mylog, you could do the following:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) set dprintf-style call
(gdb) set dprintf-function fprintf
(gdb) set dprintf-channel mylog
(gdb) dprintf 25,"at line 25, glob=%d\n",glob
Dprintf 1 at 0x123456: file main.c, line 25.
(gdb) info break
1       dprintf        keep y   0x00123456 in main at main.c:25
        call (void) fprintf (mylog,"at line 25, glob=%d\n",glob)
        continue
(gdb)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note that the info break displays the dynamic printf commands as normal breakpoint commands; you can thus easily see the effect of the variable settings.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set disconnected-dprintf_0"><b>set disconnected-dprintf</b></a> on</li>
	<li>set disconnected&ndash;dprintf off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Choose whether dprintf commands should continue to run if GDB has disconnected from the target. This only applies if the dprintf&ndash;style is agent.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show disconnected-dprintf_0"><b>show disconnected-dprintf</b></a> off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current choice for disconnected dprintf.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	GDB does not check the validity of function and channel, relying on you to supply values that are meaningful for the contexts in which they are being used. For instance, the function and channel may be the values of local variables, but if that is the case, then all enabled dynamic prints must be at locations within the scope of those locals. If evaluation fails, GDB will report an error.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_7cb0e137" href="#TOC_HEAD_7cb0e137">5.1.9 How to save breakpoints to a file</a></H3>
<p>
	To save breakpoint definitions to a file use the save breakpoints command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_save breakpoints_0"><b>save breakpoints</b></a> [filename]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command saves all current breakpoint definitions together with their commands and ignore counts, into a file filename suitable for use in a later debugging session. This includes all types of breakpoints (breakpoints, watchpoints, catchpoints, tracepoints). To read the saved breakpoint definitions, use the source command (see Command Files). Note that watchpoints with expressions involving local variables may fail to be recreated because it may not be possible to access the context where the watchpoint is valid anymore. Because the saved breakpoint definitions are simply a sequence of GDB commands that recreate the breakpoints, you can edit the file in your favorite editing program, and remove the breakpoint definitions you&rsquo;re not interested in, or that can no longer be recreated.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_da2ade5a" href="#TOC_HEAD_da2ade5a">5.1.10 Static Probe Points</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB supports SDT probes in the code. SDT stands for Statically Defined Tracing, and the probes are designed to have a tiny runtime code and data footprint, and no dynamic relocations.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, the following types of probes are supported on ELF&ndash;compatible systems:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>SystemTap (http://sourceware.org/systemtap/) SDT probes5. SystemTap probes are usable from assembly, C and C++ languages6.</li>
	<li>DTrace (http://oss.oracle.com/projects/DTrace) USDT probes. DTrace probes are usable from C and C++ languages.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	Some SystemTap probes have an associated semaphore variable; for instance, this happens automatically if you defined your probe using a DTrace&ndash;style .d file. If your probe has a semaphore, GDB will automatically enable it when you specify a breakpoint using the &lsquo;&ndash;probe&ndash;stap&rsquo; notation. But, if you put a breakpoint at a probe&rsquo;s location by some other method (e.g., break file:line), then GDB will not automatically set the semaphore. DTrace probes do not support semaphores.
</p>
<p>
	You can examine the available static static probes using info probes, with optional arguments:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info probes_0"><b>info probes</b></a> [type] [provider [name [objfile]]]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If given, type is either stap for listing SystemTap probes or dtrace for listing DTrace probes. If omitted all probes are listed regardless of their types.
	</p>
	<p>
		If given, provider is a regular expression used to match against provider names when selecting which probes to list. If omitted, probes by all probes from all providers are listed.
	</p>
	<p>
		If given, name is a regular expression to match against probe names when selecting which probes to list. If omitted, probe names are not considered when deciding whether to display them.
	</p>
	<p>
		If given, objfile is a regular expression used to select which object files (executable or shared libraries) to examine. If not given, all object files are considered.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info probes all_0"><b>info probes all</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		List the available static probes, from all types.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Some probe points can be enabled and/or disabled. The effect of enabling or disabling a probe depends on the type of probe being handled. Some DTrace probes can be enabled or disabled, but SystemTap probes cannot be disabled.
</p>
<p>
	You can enable (or disable) one or more probes using the following commands, with optional arguments:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_enable probes_0"><b>enable probes</b></a> [provider [name [objfile]]]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If given, provider is a regular expression used to match against provider names when selecting which probes to enable. If omitted, all probes from all providers are enabled.
	</p>
	<p>
		If given, name is a regular expression to match against probe names when selecting which probes to enable. If omitted, probe names are not considered when deciding whether to enable them.
	</p>
	<p>
		If given, objfile is a regular expression used to select which object files (executable or shared libraries) to examine. If not given, all object files are considered.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_disable probes_0"><b>disable probes</b></a> [provider [name [objfile]]]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		See the enable probes command above for a description of the optional arguments accepted by this command.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	A probe may specify up to twelve arguments. These are available at the point at which the probe is defined&mdash;that is, when the current PC is at the probe&rsquo;s location. The arguments are available using the convenience variables (see Convenience Vars) $_probe_arg0&hellip;$_probe_arg11. In SystemTap probes each probe argument is an integer of the appropriate size; types are not preserved. In DTrace probes types are preserved provided that they are recognized as such by GDB; otherwise the value of the probe argument will be a long integer. The convenience variable $_probe_argc holds the number of arguments at the current probe point.
</p>
<p>
	These variables are always available, but attempts to access them at any location other than a probe point will cause GDB to give an error message.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_b684ec57" href="#TOC_HEAD_b684ec57">5.1.11 &ldquo;Cannot insert breakpoints&rdquo;</a></H3>
<p>
	If you request too many active hardware&ndash;assisted breakpoints and watchpoints, you will see this error message:
</p>
<pre><code>Stopped; cannot insert breakpoints.
You may have requested too many hardware breakpoints and watchpoints.</code></pre>
<p>
	This message is printed when you attempt to resume the program, since only then GDB knows exactly how many hardware breakpoints and watchpoints it needs to insert.
</p>
<p>
	When this message is printed, you need to disable or remove some of the hardware&ndash;assisted breakpoints and watchpoints, and then continue.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_e4067685" href="#TOC_HEAD_e4067685">5.1.12 &ldquo;Breakpoint address adjusted...&rdquo;</a></H3>
<p>
	Some processor architectures place constraints on the addresses at which breakpoints may be placed. For architectures thus constrained, GDB will attempt to adjust the breakpoint&rsquo;s address to comply with the constraints dictated by the architecture.
</p>
<p>
	One example of such an architecture is the Fujitsu FR&ndash;V. The FR&ndash;V is a VLIW architecture in which a number of RISC&ndash;like instructions may be bundled together for parallel execution. The FR&ndash;V architecture constrains the location of a breakpoint instruction within such a bundle to the instruction with the lowest address. GDB honors this constraint by adjusting a breakpoint&rsquo;s address to the first in the bundle.
</p>
<p>
	It is not uncommon for optimized code to have bundles which contain instructions from different source statements, thus it may happen that a breakpoint&rsquo;s address will be adjusted from one source statement to another. Since this adjustment may significantly alter GDB&rsquo;s breakpoint related behavior from what the user expects, a warning is printed when the breakpoint is first set and also when the breakpoint is hit.
</p>
<p>
	A warning like the one below is printed when setting a breakpoint that&rsquo;s been subject to address adjustment:
</p>
<pre><code>warning: Breakpoint address adjusted from 0x00010414 to 0x00010410.</code></pre>
<p>
	Such warnings are printed both for user settable and GDB&rsquo;s internal breakpoints. If you see one of these warnings, you should verify that a breakpoint set at the adjusted address will have the desired affect. If not, the breakpoint in question may be removed and other breakpoints may be set which will have the desired behavior. E.g., it may be sufficient to place the breakpoint at a later instruction. A conditional breakpoint may also be useful in some cases to prevent the breakpoint from triggering too often.
</p>
<p>
	GDB will also issue a warning when stopping at one of these adjusted breakpoints:
</p>
<pre><code>warning: Breakpoint 1 address previously adjusted from 0x00010414
to 0x00010410.</code></pre>
<p>
	When this warning is encountered, it may be too late to take remedial action except in cases where the breakpoint is hit earlier or more frequently than expected.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_564772fc" href="#TOC_HEAD_564772fc">5.2 Continuing and Stepping</a></H2>
<p>
	Continuing means resuming program execution until your program completes normally. In contrast, stepping means executing just one more &ldquo;step&rdquo; of your program, where &ldquo;step&rdquo; may mean either one line of source code, or one machine instruction (depending on what particular command you use). Either when continuing or when stepping, your program may stop even sooner, due to a breakpoint or a signal. (If it stops due to a signal, you may want to use handle, or use &lsquo;signal 0&rsquo; to resume execution (see Signals), or you may step into the signal&rsquo;s handler (see stepping and signal handlers).)
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_continue_0"><b>continue</b></a> [ignore&ndash;count]</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_c_0"><b>c</b></a> [ignore&ndash;count]</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_fg_0"><b>fg</b></a> [ignore&ndash;count]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Resume program execution, at the address where your program last stopped; any breakpoints set at that address are bypassed. The optional argument ignore&ndash;count allows you to specify a further number of times to ignore a breakpoint at this location; its effect is like that of ignore (see Break Conditions).
	</p>
	<p>
		The argument ignore&ndash;count is meaningful only when your program stopped due to a breakpoint. At other times, the argument to continue is ignored.
	</p>
	<p>
		The synonyms c and fg (for foreground, as the debugged program is deemed to be the foreground program) are provided purely for convenience, and have exactly the same behavior as continue.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	To resume execution at a different place, you can use return (see Returning from a Function) to go back to the calling function; or jump (see Continuing at a Different Address) to go to an arbitrary location in your program.
</p>
<p>
	A typical technique for using stepping is to set a breakpoint (see Breakpoints; Watchpoints; and Catchpoints) at the beginning of the function or the section of your program where a problem is believed to lie, run your program until it stops at that breakpoint, and then step through the suspect area, examining the variables that are interesting, until you see the problem happen.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_step_0"><b>step</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Continue running your program until control reaches a different source line, then stop it and return control to GDB. This command is abbreviated s.
	</p>
	<pre><code>Warning: If you use the step command while control is within a function that was compiled without debugging information, execution proceeds until control reaches a function that does have debugging information. Likewise, it will not step into a function which is compiled without debugging information. To step through functions without debugging information, use the stepi command, described below.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The step command only stops at the first instruction of a source line. This prevents the multiple stops that could otherwise occur in switch statements, for loops, etc. step continues to stop if a function that has debugging information is called within the line. In other words, step steps inside any functions called within the line.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, the step command only enters a function if there is line number information for the function. Otherwise it acts like the next command. This avoids problems when using cc &ndash;gl on MIPS machines. Previously, step entered subroutines if there was any debugging information about the routine.
	</p>
	<li>step count</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Continue running as in step, but do so count times. If a breakpoint is reached, or a signal not related to stepping occurs before count steps, stepping stops right away.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_next_0"><b>next</b></a> [count]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Continue to the next source line in the current (innermost) stack frame. This is similar to step, but function calls that appear within the line of code are executed without stopping. Execution stops when control reaches a different line of code at the original stack level that was executing when you gave the next command. This command is abbreviated n.
	</p>
	<p>
		An argument count is a repeat count, as for step.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next command only stops at the first instruction of a source line. This prevents multiple stops that could otherwise occur in switch statements, for loops, etc.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set step-mode_0"><b>set step-mode</b></a></li>
	<li>set step&ndash;mode on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The set step&ndash;mode on command causes the step command to stop at the first instruction of a function which contains no debug line information rather than stepping over it.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is useful in cases where you may be interested in inspecting the machine instructions of a function which has no symbolic info and do not want GDB to automatically skip over this function.
	</p>
	<li>set step&ndash;mode off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Causes the step command to step over any functions which contains no debug information. This is the default.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show step-mode_0"><b>show step-mode</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether GDB will stop in or step over functions without source line debug information.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_finish_0"><b>finish</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Continue running until just after function in the selected stack frame returns. Print the returned value (if any). This command can be abbreviated as fin.
	</p>
	<p>
		Contrast this with the return command (see Returning from a Function).
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set print finish_0"><b>set print finish</b></a> [on|off]</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show print finish_0"><b>show print finish</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		By default the finish command will show the value that is returned by the function. This can be disabled using set print finish off. When disabled, the value is still entered into the value history (see Value History), but not displayed.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_until_0"><b>until</b></a></li>

		Continue running until a source line past the current line, in the current stack frame, is reached. This command is used to avoid single stepping through a loop more than once. It is like the next command, except that when until encounters a jump, it automatically continues execution until the program counter is greater than the address of the jump.
	</p>
	<p>
		This means that when you reach the end of a loop after single stepping though it, until makes your program continue execution until it exits the loop. In contrast, a next command at the end of a loop simply steps back to the beginning of the loop, which forces you to step through the next iteration.
	</p>
	<p>
		until always stops your program if it attempts to exit the current stack frame.
	</p>
	<p>
		until may produce somewhat counterintuitive results if the order of machine code does not match the order of the source lines. For example, in the following excerpt from a debugging session, the f (frame) command shows that execution is stopped at line 206; yet when we use until, we get to line 195:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) f
#0  main (argc=4, argv=0xf7fffae8) at m4.c:206
206                 expand_input();
(gdb) until
195             for ( ; argc &gt; 0; NEXTARG) {	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This happened because, for execution efficiency, the compiler had generated code for the loop closure test at the end, rather than the start, of the loop&mdash;even though the test in a C for&ndash;loop is written before the body of the loop. The until command appeared to step back to the beginning of the loop when it advanced to this expression; however, it has not really gone to an earlier statement&mdash;not in terms of the actual machine code.
	</p>
	<p>
		until with no argument works by means of single instruction stepping, and hence is slower than until with an argument.
	</p>
	<li>until locspec</li>
	<li>u locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Continue running your program until either it reaches a code location that results from resolving locspec, or the current stack frame returns. locspec is any of the forms described in Location Specifications. This form of the command uses temporary breakpoints, and hence is quicker than until without an argument. The specified location is actually reached only if it is in the current frame. This implies that until can be used to skip over recursive function invocations. For instance in the code below, if the current location is line 96, issuing until 99 will execute the program up to line 99 in the same invocation of factorial, i.e., after the inner invocations have returned.
	</p>
	<pre><code>94	int factorial (int value)
95	{
96	    if (value &gt; 1) {
97            value *= factorial (value - 1);
98	    }
99	    return (value);
100     }	</code></pre>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_advance_0"><b>advance</b></a> locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Continue running your program until either it reaches a code location that results from resolving locspec, or the current stack frame returns. locspec is any of the forms described in Location Specifications. This command is similar to until, but advance will not skip over recursive function calls, and the target code location doesn&rsquo;t have to be in the same frame as the current one.

	<p>
		Execute one machine instruction, then stop and return to the debugger.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is often useful to do &lsquo;display/i $pc&rsquo; when stepping by machine instructions. This makes GDB automatically display the next instruction to be executed, each time your program stops. See Automatic Display.
	</p>
	<p>
		An argument is a repeat count, as in step.

	<br />
	<p>
		Execute one machine instruction, but if it is a function call, proceed until the function returns.
	</p>
	<p>
		An argument is a repeat count, as in next.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	By default, and if available, GDB makes use of target&ndash;assisted range stepping. In other words, whenever you use a stepping command (e.g., step, next), GDB tells the target to step the corresponding range of instruction addresses instead of issuing multiple single&ndash;steps. This speeds up line stepping, particularly for remote targets. Ideally, there should be no reason you would want to turn range stepping off. However, it&rsquo;s possible that a bug in the debug info, a bug in the remote stub (for remote targets), or even a bug in GDB could make line stepping behave incorrectly when target&ndash;assisted range stepping is enabled. You can use the following command to turn off range stepping if necessary:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set range-stepping_0"><b>set range-stepping</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show range-stepping_0"><b>show range-stepping</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control whether range stepping is enabled.
	</p>
	<p>
		If on, and the target supports it, GDB tells the target to step a range of addresses itself, instead of issuing multiple single&ndash;steps. If off, GDB always issues single&ndash;steps, even if range stepping is supported by the target. The default is on.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_34370706" href="#TOC_HEAD_34370706">5.3 Skipping Over Functions and Files</a></H2>
<p>
	The program you are debugging may contain some functions which are uninteresting to debug. The skip command lets you tell GDB to skip a function, all functions in a file or a particular function in a particular file when stepping.
</p>
<p>
	For example, consider the following C function:
</p>
<pre><code>101     int func()
102     {
103         foo(boring());
104         bar(boring());
105     }</code></pre>
<p>
	Suppose you wish to step into the functions foo and bar, but you are not interested in stepping through boring. If you run step at line 103, you&rsquo;ll enter boring(), but if you run next, you&rsquo;ll step over both foo and boring!
</p>
<p>
	One solution is to step into boring and use the finish command to immediately exit it. But this can become tedious if boring is called from many places.
</p>
<p>
	A more flexible solution is to execute skip boring. This instructs GDB never to step into boring. Now when you execute step at line 103, you&rsquo;ll step over boring and directly into foo.
</p>
<p>
	Functions may be skipped by providing either a function name, linespec (see Location Specifications), regular expression that matches the function&rsquo;s name, file name or a glob&ndash;style pattern that matches the file name.
</p>
<p>
	On Posix systems the form of the regular expression is &ldquo;Extended Regular Expressions&rdquo;. See for example &lsquo;man 7 regex&rsquo; on GNU/Linux systems. On non&ndash;Posix systems the form of the regular expression is whatever is provided by the regcomp function of the underlying system. See for example &lsquo;man 7 glob&rsquo; on GNU/Linux systems for a description of glob&ndash;style patterns.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_skip_0"><b>skip</b></a> [options]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The basic form of the skip command takes zero or more options that specify what to skip. The options argument is any useful combination of the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&ndash;file file</li>
		<li>&ndash;fi file</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Functions in file will be skipped over when stepping.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;gfile file&ndash;glob&ndash;pattern</li>
		<li>&ndash;gfi file&ndash;glob&ndash;pattern</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Functions in files matching file&ndash;glob&ndash;pattern will be skipped over when stepping.
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) skip -gfi utils/*.c		</code></pre>
		<li>&ndash;function linespec</li>
		<li>&ndash;fu linespec</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Functions named by linespec or the function containing the line named by linespec will be skipped over when stepping. See Location Specifications.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;rfunction regexp</li>
		<li>&ndash;rfu regexp</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Functions whose name matches regexp will be skipped over when stepping.
		</p>
		<p>
			This form is useful for complex function names. For example, there is generally no need to step into C++ std::string constructors or destructors. Plus with C++ templates it can be hard to write out the full name of the function, and often it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the template arguments are. Specifying the function to be skipped as a regular expression makes this easier.
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) skip -rfu ^std::(allocator|basic_string)&lt;.*&gt;::~?\1 *\(		</code></pre>
		<p>
			If you want to skip every templated C++ constructor and destructor in the std namespace you can do:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) skip -rfu ^std::([a-zA-z0-9_]+)&lt;.*&gt;::~?\1 *\(		</code></pre>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If no options are specified, the function you&rsquo;re currently debugging will be skipped.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_skip function_0"><b>skip function</b></a> [linespec]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		After running this command, the function named by linespec or the function containing the line named by linespec will be skipped over when stepping. See Location Specifications.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you do not specify linespec, the function you&rsquo;re currently debugging will be skipped.
	</p>
	<p>
		(If you have a function called file that you want to skip, use skip function file.)
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_skip file_0"><b>skip file</b></a> [filename]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		After running this command, any function whose source lives in filename will be skipped over when stepping.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) skip file boring.c
File boring.c will be skipped when stepping.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If you do not specify filename, functions whose source lives in the file you&rsquo;re currently debugging will be skipped.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Skips can be listed, deleted, disabled, and enabled, much like breakpoints. These are the commands for managing your list of skips:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info skip_0"><b>info skip</b></a> [range]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print details about the specified skip(s). If range is not specified, print a table with details about all functions and files marked for skipping. info skip prints the following information about each skip:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Identifier</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			A number identifying this skip.
		</p>
		<li>Enabled or Disabled</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Enabled skips are marked with &lsquo;y&rsquo;. Disabled skips are marked with &lsquo;n&rsquo;.
		</p>
		<li>Glob</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			If the file name is a &lsquo;glob&rsquo; pattern this is &lsquo;y&rsquo;. Otherwise it is &lsquo;n&rsquo;.
		</p>
		<li>File</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The name or &lsquo;glob&rsquo; pattern of the file to be skipped. If no file is specified this is &lsquo;&lt;none&gt;&rsquo;.
		</p>
		<li>RE</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			If the function name is a &lsquo;regular expression&rsquo; this is &lsquo;y&rsquo;. Otherwise it is &lsquo;n&rsquo;.
		</p>
		<li>Function</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The name or regular expression of the function to skip. If no function is specified this is &lsquo;&lt;none&gt;&rsquo;.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_skip delete_0"><b>skip delete</b></a> [range]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Delete the specified skip(s). If range is not specified, delete all skips.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_skip enable_0"><b>skip enable</b></a> [range]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable the specified skip(s). If range is not specified, enable all skips.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_skip disable_0"><b>skip disable</b></a> [range]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable the specified skip(s). If range is not specified, disable all skips.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set debug skip_0"><b>set debug skip</b></a> [on|off]</li>

	<p>
		Set whether to print the debug output about skipping files and functions.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show debug skip_0"><b>show debug skip</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether the debug output about skipping files and functions is printed.

</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_b2487c46" href="#TOC_HEAD_b2487c46">5.4 Signals</a></H2>
<p>
	A signal is an asynchronous event that can happen in a program. The operating system defines the possible kinds of signals, and gives each kind a name and a number. For example, in Unix SIGINT is the signal a program gets when you type an interrupt character (often Ctrl&ndash;c); SIGSEGV is the signal a program gets from referencing a place in memory far away from all the areas in use; SIGALRM occurs when the alarm clock timer goes off (which happens only if your program has requested an alarm).
</p>
<p>
	Some signals, including SIGALRM, are a normal part of the functioning of your program. Others, such as SIGSEGV, indicate errors; these signals are fatal (they kill your program immediately) if the program has not specified in advance some other way to handle the signal. SIGINT does not indicate an error in your program, but it is normally fatal so it can carry out the purpose of the interrupt: to kill the program.
</p>
<p>
	GDB has the ability to detect any occurrence of a signal in your program. You can tell GDB in advance what to do for each kind of signal.
</p>
<p>
	Normally, GDB is set up to let the non&ndash;erroneous signals like SIGALRM be silently passed to your program (so as not to interfere with their role in the program&rsquo;s functioning) but to stop your program immediately whenever an error signal happens. You can change these settings with the handle command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info signals_0"><b>info signals</b></a></li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info handle_0"><b>info handle</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print a table of all the kinds of signals and how GDB has been told to handle each one. You can use this to see the signal numbers of all the defined types of signals.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_info signals_1"><b>info signals</b></a> sig</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Similar, but print information only about the specified signal number.
	</p>
	<p>
		info handle is an alias for info signals.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_catch signal_0"><b>catch signal</b></a> [signal&hellip; | &lsquo;all&rsquo;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a catchpoint for the indicated signals. See Set Catchpoints, for details about this command.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_handle signal_0"><b>handle signal</b></a> [ signal &hellip; ] [keywords&hellip;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Change the way GDB handles each signal. Each signal can be the number of a signal or its name (with or without the &lsquo;SIG&rsquo; at the beginning); a list of signal numbers of the form &lsquo;low&ndash;high&rsquo;; or the word &lsquo;all&rsquo;, meaning all the known signals, except SIGINT and SIGTRAP, which are used by GDB. Optional argument keywords, described below, say what changes to make to all of the specified signals.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The keywords allowed by the handle command can be abbreviated. Their full names are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>nostop</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB should not stop your program when this signal happens. It may still print a message telling you that the signal has come in.
		stop
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB should stop your program when this signal happens. This implies the print keyword as well.
	</p>
	<li>print</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB should print a message when this signal happens.
	</p>
	<li>noprint</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB should not mention the occurrence of the signal at all. This implies the nostop keyword as well.
	</p>
	<li>pass</li>
	<li>noignore</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB should allow your program to see this signal; your program can handle the signal, or else it may terminate if the signal is fatal and not handled. pass and noignore are synonyms.
	</p>
	<li>nopass</li>
	<li>ignore</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB should not allow your program to see this signal. nopass and ignore are synonyms.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	When a signal stops your program, the signal is not visible to the program until you continue. Your program sees the signal then, if pass is in effect for the signal in question at that time. In other words, after GDB reports a signal, you can use the handle command with pass or nopass to control whether your program sees that signal when you continue.
</p>
<p>
	The default is set to nostop, noprint, pass for non&ndash;erroneous signals such as SIGALRM, SIGWINCH and SIGCHLD, and to stop, print, pass for the erroneous signals.
</p>
<p>
	You can also use the signal command to prevent your program from seeing a signal, or cause it to see a signal it normally would not see, or to give it any signal at any time. For example, if your program stopped due to some sort of memory reference error, you might store correct values into the erroneous variables and continue, hoping to see more execution; but your program would probably terminate immediately as a result of the fatal signal once it saw the signal. To prevent this, you can continue with &lsquo;signal 0&rsquo;. See Giving your Program a Signal.
</p>
<p>
	GDB optimizes for stepping the mainline code. If a signal that has handle nostop and handle pass set arrives while a stepping command (e.g., stepi, step, next) is in progress, GDB lets the signal handler run and then resumes stepping the mainline code once the signal handler returns. In other words, GDB steps over the signal handler. This prevents signals that you&rsquo;ve specified as not interesting (with handle nostop) from changing the focus of debugging unexpectedly. Note that the signal handler itself may still hit a breakpoint, stop for another signal that has handle stop in effect, or for any other event that normally results in stopping the stepping command sooner. Also note that GDB still informs you that the program received a signal if handle print is set.
</p>
<p>
	If you set handle pass for a signal, and your program sets up a handler for it, then issuing a stepping command, such as step or stepi, when your program is stopped due to the signal will step into the signal handler (if the target supports that).
</p>
<p>
	Likewise, if you use the queue&ndash;signal command to queue a signal to be delivered to the current thread when execution of the thread resumes (see Giving your Program a Signal), then a stepping command will step into the signal handler.
</p>
<p>
	Here&rsquo;s an example, using stepi to step to the first instruction of SIGUSR1&rsquo;s handler:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) handle SIGUSR1
Signal        Stop      Print   Pass to program Description
SIGUSR1       Yes       Yes     Yes             User defined signal 1
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Program received signal SIGUSR1, User defined signal 1.
main () sigusr1.c:28
28        p = 0;
(gdb) si
sigusr1_handler () at sigusr1.c:9
9       {</code></pre>
<p>
	The same, but using queue&ndash;signal instead of waiting for the program to receive the signal first:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) n
28        p = 0;
(gdb) queue-signal SIGUSR1
(gdb) si
sigusr1_handler () at sigusr1.c:9
9       {
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	On some targets, GDB can inspect extra signal information associated with the intercepted signal, before it is actually delivered to the program being debugged. This information is exported by the convenience variable $_siginfo, and consists of data that is passed by the kernel to the signal handler at the time of the receipt of a signal. The data type of the information itself is target dependent. You can see the data type using the ptype $_siginfo command. On Unix systems, it typically corresponds to the standard siginfo_t type, as defined in the signal.h system header.
</p>
<p>
	Here&rsquo;s an example, on a GNU/Linux system, printing the stray referenced address that raised a segmentation fault.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) continue
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000000000400766 in main ()
69        *(int *)p = 0;
(gdb) ptype $_siginfo
type = struct {
    int si_signo;
    int si_errno;
    int si_code;
    union {
        int _pad[28];
        struct {...} _kill;
        struct {...} _timer;
        struct {...} _rt;
        struct {...} _sigchld;
        struct {...} _sigfault;
        struct {...} _sigpoll;
    } _sifields;
}
(gdb) ptype $_siginfo._sifields._sigfault
type = struct {
    void *si_addr;
}
(gdb) p $_siginfo._sifields._sigfault.si_addr
$1 = (void *) 0x7ffff7ff7000</code></pre>
<p>
	Depending on target support, $_siginfo may also be writable.
</p>
<p>
	On some targets, a SIGSEGV can be caused by a boundary violation, i.e., accessing an address outside of the allowed range. In those cases GDB may displays additional information, depending on how GDB has been told to handle the signal. With handle stop SIGSEGV, GDB displays the violation kind: &quot;Upper&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot;, the memory address accessed and the bounds, while with handle nostop SIGSEGV no additional information is displayed.
</p>
<p>
	The usual output of a segfault is:
</p>
<pre><code>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
0x0000000000400d7c in upper () at i386-mpx-sigsegv.c:68
68        value = *(p + len);</code></pre>
<p>
	While a bound violation is presented as:
</p>
<pre><code>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
Upper bound violation while accessing address 0x7fffffffc3b3
Bounds: [lower = 0x7fffffffc390, upper = 0x7fffffffc3a3]
0x0000000000400d7c in upper () at i386-mpx-sigsegv.c:68
68        value = *(p + len);</code></pre>

<p>
	GDB supports debugging programs with multiple threads (see Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads). There are two modes of controlling execution of your program within the debugger. In the default mode, referred to as all&ndash;stop mode, when any thread in your program stops (for example, at a breakpoint or while being stepped), all other threads in the program are also stopped by GDB. On some targets, GDB also supports non&ndash;stop mode, in which other threads can continue to run freely while you examine the stopped thread in the debugger.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_f5435ad4" href="#TOC_HEAD_f5435ad4">5.5.1 All&ndash;Stop Mode</a></H3><ul><a href="../tags/gdb-all-stop.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>gdb-all-stop</a>&nbsp;</ul>
<p>
	In all&ndash;stop mode, whenever your program stops under GDB for any reason, all threads of execution stop, not just the current thread. This allows you to examine the overall state of the program, including switching between threads, without worrying that things may change underfoot.
</p>
<p>
	Conversely, whenever you restart the program, all threads start executing. This is true even when single&ndash;stepping with commands like step or next.
</p>
<p>
	In particular, GDB cannot single&ndash;step all threads in lockstep. Since thread scheduling is up to your debugging target&rsquo;s operating system (not controlled by GDB), other threads may execute more than one statement while the current thread completes a single step. Moreover, in general other threads stop in the middle of a statement, rather than at a clean statement boundary, when the program stops.
</p>
<p>
	You might even find your program stopped in another thread after continuing or even single&ndash;stepping. This happens whenever some other thread runs into a breakpoint, a signal, or an exception before the first thread completes whatever you requested.
</p>
<p>
	Whenever GDB stops your program, due to a breakpoint or a signal, it automatically selects the thread where that breakpoint or signal happened. GDB alerts you to the context switch with a message such as &lsquo;[Switching to Thread n]&rsquo; to identify the thread.
</p>
<p>
	On some OSes, you can modify GDB&rsquo;s default behavior by locking the OS scheduler to allow only a single thread to run.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set scheduler-locking_0"><b>set scheduler-locking</b></a> mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the scheduler locking mode. It applies to normal execution, record mode, and replay mode. mode can be one of the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>off</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			There is no locking and any thread may run at any time.
		</p>
		<li>on</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Only the current thread may run when the inferior is resumed.
		</p>
		<li>step</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Behaves like on when stepping, and off otherwise. Threads other than the current never get a chance to run when you step, and they are completely free to run when you use commands like &lsquo;continue&rsquo;, &lsquo;until&rsquo;, or &lsquo;finish&rsquo;.
		</p>
		<p>
			This mode optimizes for single&ndash;stepping; it prevents other threads from preempting the current thread while you are stepping, so that the focus of debugging does not change unexpectedly. However, unless another thread hits a breakpoint during its timeslice, GDB does not change the current thread away from the thread that you are debugging.
		</p>
		<li>replay</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Behaves like on in replay mode, and off in either record mode or during normal execution. This is the default mode.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show scheduler-locking_0"><b>show scheduler-locking</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current scheduler locking mode.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	By default, when you issue one of the execution commands such as continue, next or step, GDB allows only threads of the current inferior to run. For example, if GDB is attached to two inferiors, each with two threads, the continue command resumes only the two threads of the current inferior. This is useful, for example, when you debug a program that forks and you want to hold the parent stopped (so that, for instance, it doesn&rsquo;t run to exit), while you debug the child. In other situations, you may not be interested in inspecting the current state of any of the processes GDB is attached to, and you may want to resume them all until some breakpoint is hit. In the latter case, you can instruct GDB to allow all threads of all the inferiors to run with the set schedule&ndash;multiple command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set schedule-multiple_0"><b>set schedule-multiple</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the mode for allowing threads of multiple processes to be resumed when an execution command is issued. When on, all threads of all processes are allowed to run. When off, only the threads of the current process are resumed. The default is off. The scheduler&ndash;locking mode takes precedence when set to on, or while you are stepping and set to step.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show schedule-multiple_0"><b>show schedule-multiple</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current mode for resuming the execution of threads of multiple processes.

<p>
	For some multi&ndash;threaded targets, GDB supports an optional mode of operation in which you can examine stopped program threads in the debugger while other threads continue to execute freely. This minimizes intrusion when debugging live systems, such as programs where some threads have real&ndash;time constraints or must continue to respond to external events. This is referred to as non&ndash;stop mode.
</p>
<p>
	In non&ndash;stop mode, when a thread stops to report a debugging event, only that thread is stopped; GDB does not stop other threads as well, in contrast to the all&ndash;stop mode behavior. Additionally, execution commands such as continue and step apply by default only to the current thread in non&ndash;stop mode, rather than all threads as in all&ndash;stop mode. This allows you to control threads explicitly in ways that are not possible in all&ndash;stop mode &mdash; for example, stepping one thread while allowing others to run freely, stepping one thread while holding all others stopped, or stepping several threads independently and simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
	To enter non&ndash;stop mode, use this sequence of commands before you run or attach to your program:
</p>
<pre><code># If using the CLI, pagination breaks non-stop.
set pagination off

# Finally, turn it on!
set non-stop on</code></pre>
<p>
	You can use these commands to manipulate the non&ndash;stop mode setting:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="HEAD_HIDDEN_e7720d9f"><a name="wd_ln_set non-stop_0"><b>set non-stop</b></a> on &nbsp;<a href="../tags/gdb-set-non-stop.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>gdb-set-non-stop</a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable selection of non&ndash;stop mode.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set non-stop_1"><b>set non-stop</b></a> off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable selection of non&ndash;stop mode.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show non-stop_0"><b>show non-stop</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current non&ndash;stop enablement setting.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Note these commands only reflect whether non&ndash;stop mode is enabled, not whether the currently&ndash;executing program is being run in non&ndash;stop mode. In particular, the set non&ndash;stop preference is only consulted when GDB starts or connects to the target program, and it is generally not possible to switch modes once debugging has started. Furthermore, since not all targets support non&ndash;stop mode, even when you have enabled non&ndash;stop mode, GDB may still fall back to all&ndash;stop operation by default.
</p>
<p>
	In non&ndash;stop mode, all execution commands apply only to the current thread by default. That is, continue only continues one thread. To continue all threads, issue continue &ndash;a or c &ndash;a.
</p>
<p>
	You can use GDB&rsquo;s background execution commands (see Background Execution) to run some threads in the background while you continue to examine or step others from GDB. The MI execution commands (see GDB/MI Program Execution) are always executed asynchronously in non&ndash;stop mode.
</p>
<p>
	Suspending execution is done with the interrupt command when running in the background, or Ctrl&ndash;c during foreground execution. In all&ndash;stop mode, this stops the whole process; but in non&ndash;stop mode the interrupt applies only to the current thread. To stop the whole program, use interrupt &ndash;a.
</p>
<p>
	Other execution commands do not currently support the &ndash;a option.
</p>
<p>
	In non&ndash;stop mode, when a thread stops, GDB doesn&rsquo;t automatically make that thread current, as it does in all&ndash;stop mode. This is because the thread stop notifications are asynchronous with respect to GDB&rsquo;s command interpreter, and it would be confusing if GDB unexpectedly changed to a different thread just as you entered a command to operate on the previously current thread.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_5213bde5" href="#TOC_HEAD_5213bde5">5.5.3 Background Execution</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB&rsquo;s execution commands have two variants: the normal foreground (synchronous) behavior, and a background (asynchronous) behavior. In foreground execution, GDB waits for the program to report that some thread has stopped before prompting for another command. In background execution, GDB immediately gives a command prompt so that you can issue other commands while your program runs.
</p>
<p>
	If the target doesn&rsquo;t support async mode, GDB issues an error message if you attempt to use the background execution commands.
</p>
<p>
	To specify background execution, add a &amp; to the command. For example, the background form of the continue command is continue&amp;, or just c&amp;. The execution commands that accept background execution are:
</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>
	Background execution is especially useful in conjunction with non&ndash;stop mode for debugging programs with multiple threads; see Non&ndash;Stop Mode. However, you can also use these commands in the normal all&ndash;stop mode with the restriction that you cannot issue another execution command until the previous one finishes. Examples of commands that are valid in all&ndash;stop mode while the program is running include help and info break.
</p>
<p>
	You can interrupt your program while it is running in the background by using the interrupt command.
</p>
<pre><code>interrupt
interrupt -a

Suspend execution of the running program. In all-stop mode, interrupt stops the whole process, but in non-stop mode, it stops only the current thread. To stop the whole program in non-stop mode, use interrupt -a.</code></pre>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_15d504d9" href="#TOC_HEAD_15d504d9">5.5.4 Thread&ndash;Specific Breakpoints</a></H3>
<p>
	When your program has multiple threads (see Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads), you can choose whether to set breakpoints on all threads, or on a particular thread.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>break locspec thread thread&ndash;id</li>
	<li>break locspec thread thread&ndash;id if &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		locspec specifies a code location or locations in your program. See Location Specifications, for details.
	</p>
	<p>
		Use the qualifier &lsquo;thread thread&ndash;id&rsquo; with a breakpoint command to specify that you only want GDB to stop the program when a particular thread reaches this breakpoint. The thread&ndash;id specifier is one of the thread identifiers assigned by GDB, shown in the first column of the &lsquo;info threads&rsquo; display.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you do not specify &lsquo;thread thread&ndash;id&rsquo; when you set a breakpoint, the breakpoint applies to all threads of your program.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use the thread qualifier on conditional breakpoints as well; in this case, place &lsquo;thread thread&ndash;id&rsquo; before or after the breakpoint condition, like this:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) break frik.c:13 thread 28 if bartab &gt; lim	</code></pre>
</ul>
<p>
	Thread&ndash;specific breakpoints are automatically deleted when GDB detects the corresponding thread is no longer in the thread list. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) c
Thread-specific breakpoint 3 deleted - thread 28 no longer in the thread list.</code></pre>
<p>
	There are several ways for a thread to disappear, such as a regular thread exit, but also when you detach from the process with the detach command (see Debugging an Already&ndash;running Process), or if GDB loses the remote connection (see Remote Debugging), etc. Note that with some targets, GDB is only able to detect a thread has exited when the user explictly asks for the thread list with the info threads command.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_635093df" href="#TOC_HEAD_635093df">5.5.5 Interrupted System Calls</a></H3>
<p>
	There is an unfortunate side effect when using GDB to debug multi&ndash;threaded programs. If one thread stops for a breakpoint, or for some other reason, and another thread is blocked in a system call, then the system call may return prematurely. This is a consequence of the interaction between multiple threads and the signals that GDB uses to implement breakpoints and other events that stop execution.
</p>
<p>
	To handle this problem, your program should check the return value of each system call and react appropriately. This is good programming style anyways.
</p>
<p>
	For example, do not write code like this:
</p>
<pre><code>sleep (10);</code></pre>
<p>
	The call to sleep will return early if a different thread stops at a breakpoint or for some other reason.
</p>
<p>
	Instead, write this:
</p>
<pre><code>int unslept = 10;
while (unslept &gt; 0)
unslept = sleep (unslept);</code></pre>
<p>
	A system call is allowed to return early, so the system is still conforming to its specification. But GDB does cause your multi&ndash;threaded program to behave differently than it would without GDB.
</p>
<p>
	Also, GDB uses internal breakpoints in the thread library to monitor certain events such as thread creation and thread destruction. When such an event happens, a system call in another thread may return prematurely, even though your program does not appear to stop.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_ad8f2111" href="#TOC_HEAD_ad8f2111">5.5.6 Observer Mode</a></H3>
<p>
	If you want to build on non&ndash;stop mode and observe program behavior without any chance of disruption by GDB, you can set variables to disable all of the debugger&rsquo;s attempts to modify state, whether by writing memory, inserting breakpoints, etc. These operate at a low level, intercepting operations from all commands.
</p>
<p>
	When all of these are set to off, then GDB is said to be observer mode. As a convenience, the variable observer can be set to disable these, plus enable non&ndash;stop mode.
</p>
<p>
	Note that GDB will not prevent you from making nonsensical combinations of these settings. For instance, if you have enabled may&ndash;insert&ndash;breakpoints but disabled may&ndash;write&ndash;memory, then breakpoints that work by writing trap instructions into the code stream will still not be able to be placed.
</p>
<ul>

	<li><a name="wd_ln_set observer_1"><b>set observer</b></a> off</li>

	<H1><a name="HEAD_66fd9ac9" href="#TOC_HEAD_66fd9ac9">6 Running programs backward</a></H1><ul><a href="../tags/gdb-reverse-debug.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>gdb-reverse-debug</a>&nbsp;</ul>
<p>
	When you are debugging a program, it is not unusual to realize that you have gone too far, and some event of interest has already happened. If the target environment supports it, GDB can allow you to &ldquo;rewind&rdquo; the program by running it backward.
</p>
<p>
	A target environment that supports reverse execution should be able to &ldquo;undo&rdquo; the changes in machine state that have taken place as the program was executing normally. Variables, registers etc. should revert to their previous values. Obviously this requires a great deal of sophistication on the part of the target environment; not all target environments can support reverse execution.
</p>
<p>
	When a program is executed in reverse, the instructions that have most recently been executed are &ldquo;un&ndash;executed&rdquo;, in reverse order. The program counter runs backward, following the previous thread of execution in reverse. As each instruction is &ldquo;un&ndash;executed&rdquo;, the values of memory and/or registers that were changed by that instruction are reverted to their previous states. After executing a piece of source code in reverse, all side effects of that code should be &ldquo;undone&rdquo;, and all variables should be returned to their prior values7.
</p>
<p>
	On some platforms, GDB has built&ndash;in support for reverse execution, activated with the record or record btrace commands. See Process Record and Replay. Some remote targets, typically full system emulators, support reverse execution directly without requiring any special command.
</p>
<p>
	If you are debugging in a target environment that supports reverse execution, GDB provides the following commands.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_reverse-continue_0"><b>reverse-continue</b></a> [ignore&ndash;count]</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_rc_0"><b>rc</b></a> [ignore&ndash;count]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Beginning at the point where your program last stopped, start executing in reverse. Reverse execution will stop for breakpoints and synchronous exceptions (signals), just like normal execution. Behavior of asynchronous signals depends on the target environment.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_reverse-step_0" target="_blank" href="../tags/reverse-step.html"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>reverse-step</a> [count]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Run the program backward until control reaches the start of a different source line; then stop it, and return control to GDB.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like the step command, reverse&ndash;step will only stop at the beginning of a source line. It &ldquo;un&ndash;executes&rdquo; the previously executed source line. If the previous source line included calls to debuggable functions, reverse&ndash;step will step (backward) into the called function, stopping at the beginning of the last statement in the called function (typically a return statement).
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, as with the step command, if non&ndash;debuggable functions are called, reverse&ndash;step will run thru them backward without stopping.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_reverse-stepi_0"><b>reverse-stepi</b></a> [count]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Reverse&ndash;execute one machine instruction. Note that the instruction to be reverse&ndash;executed is not the one pointed to by the program counter, but the instruction executed prior to that one. For instance, if the last instruction was a jump, reverse&ndash;stepi will take you back from the destination of the jump to the jump instruction itself.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_reverse-next_0"><b>reverse-next</b></a> [count]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Run backward to the beginning of the previous line executed in the current (innermost) stack frame. If the line contains function calls, they will be &ldquo;un&ndash;executed&rdquo; without stopping. Starting from the first line of a function, reverse&ndash;next will take you back to the caller of that function, before the function was called, just as the normal next command would take you from the last line of a function back to its return to its caller 8.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_reverse-nexti_0"><b>reverse-nexti</b></a> [count]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like nexti, reverse&ndash;nexti executes a single instruction in reverse, except that called functions are &ldquo;un&ndash;executed&rdquo; atomically. That is, if the previously executed instruction was a return from another function, reverse&ndash;nexti will continue to execute in reverse until the call to that function (from the current stack frame) is reached.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_reverse-finish_0"><b>reverse-finish</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Just as the finish command takes you to the point where the current function returns, reverse&ndash;finish takes you to the point where it was called. Instead of ending up at the end of the current function invocation, you end up at the beginning.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set exec-direction_0"><b>set exec-direction</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the direction of target execution.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set exec-direction reverse_0"><b>set exec-direction reverse</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB will perform all execution commands in reverse, until the exec&ndash;direction mode is changed to &ldquo;forward&rdquo;. Affected commands include step, stepi, next, nexti, continue, and finish. The return command cannot be used in reverse mode.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set exec-direction forward_0"><b>set exec-direction forward</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB will perform all execution commands in the normal fashion. This is the default.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H1><a name="HEAD_fcab3bf1" href="#TOC_HEAD_fcab3bf1">7 Recording Inferior&rsquo;s Execution and Replaying It</a></H1><ul><a href="../tags/Record-Replay.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>Record-Replay</a>&nbsp;</ul>
<p>
	On some platforms, GDB provides a special process record and replay target that can record a log of the process execution, and replay it later with both forward and reverse execution commands.
</p>
<p>
	When this target is in use, if the execution log includes the record for the next instruction, GDB will debug in replay mode. In the replay mode, the inferior does not really execute code instructions. Instead, all the events that normally happen during code execution are taken from the execution log. While code is not really executed in replay mode, the values of registers (including the program counter register) and the memory of the inferior are still changed as they normally would. Their contents are taken from the execution log.
</p>
<p>
	If the record for the next instruction is not in the execution log, GDB will debug in record mode. In this mode, the inferior executes normally, and GDB records the execution log for future replay.
</p>
<p>
	The process record and replay target supports reverse execution (see Reverse Execution), even if the platform on which the inferior runs does not. However, the reverse execution is limited in this case by the range of the instructions recorded in the execution log. In other words, reverse execution on platforms that don&rsquo;t support it directly can only be done in the replay mode.
</p>
<p>
	When debugging in the reverse direction, GDB will work in replay mode as long as the execution log includes the record for the previous instruction; otherwise, it will work in record mode, if the platform supports reverse execution, or stop if not.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, process record and replay is supported on ARM, Aarch64, Moxie, PowerPC, PowerPC64, S/390, and x86 (i386/amd64) running GNU/Linux. Process record and replay can be used both when native debugging, and when remote debugging via gdbserver.
</p>
<p>
	For architecture environments that support process record and replay, GDB provides the following commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_record_0"><b>record</b></a> method</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command starts the process record and replay target. The recording method can be specified as parameter. Without a parameter the command uses the full recording method. The following recording methods are available:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>full</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Full record/replay recording using GDB&rsquo;s software record and replay implementation. This method allows replaying and reverse execution.
		</p>
		<li>btrace format</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Hardware&ndash;supported instruction recording, supported on Intel processors. This method does not record data. Further, the data is collected in a ring buffer so old data will be overwritten when the buffer is full. It allows limited reverse execution. Variables and registers are not available during reverse execution. In remote debugging, recording continues on disconnect. Recorded data can be inspected after reconnecting. The recording may be stopped using record stop.
		</p>
		<p>
			The recording format can be specified as parameter. Without a parameter the command chooses the recording format. The following recording formats are available:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>bts</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Use the Branch Trace Store (BTS) recording format. In this format, the processor stores a from/to record for each executed branch in the btrace ring buffer.
			</p>
			<li>pt</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Use the Intel Processor Trace recording format. In this format, the processor stores the execution trace in a compressed form that is afterwards decoded by GDB.
			</p>
			<p>
				The trace can be recorded with very low overhead. The compressed trace format also allows small trace buffers to already contain a big number of instructions compared to BTS.
			</p>
			<p>
				Decoding the recorded execution trace, on the other hand, is more expensive than decoding BTS trace. This is mostly due to the increased number of instructions to process. You should increase the buffer&ndash;size with care.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Not all recording formats may be available on all processors.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The process record and replay target can only debug a process that is already running. Therefore, you need first to start the process with the run or start commands, and then start the recording with the record method command.
	</p>
	<p>
		Displaced stepping (see displaced stepping) will be automatically disabled when process record and replay target is started. That&rsquo;s because the process record and replay target doesn&rsquo;t support displaced stepping.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the inferior is in the non&ndash;stop mode (see Non&ndash;Stop Mode) or in the asynchronous execution mode (see Background Execution), not all recording methods are available. The full recording method does not support these two modes.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_record stop_0"><b>record stop</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Stop the process record and replay target. When process record and replay target stops, the entire execution log will be deleted and the inferior will either be terminated, or will remain in its final state.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you stop the process record and replay target in record mode (at the end of the execution log), the inferior will be stopped at the next instruction that would have been recorded. In other words, if you record for a while and then stop recording, the inferior process will be left in the same state as if the recording never happened.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand, if the process record and replay target is stopped while in replay mode (that is, not at the end of the execution log, but at some earlier point), the inferior process will become &ldquo;live&rdquo; at that earlier state, and it will then be possible to continue the usual &ldquo;live&rdquo; debugging of the process from that state.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the inferior process exits, or GDB detaches from it, process record and replay target will automatically stop itself.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_record goto_0"><b>record goto</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Go to a specific location in the execution log. There are several ways to specify the location to go to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>record goto begin</li>
		<li>record goto start</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Go to the beginning of the execution log.
		</p>
		<li>record goto end</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Go to the end of the execution log.
		</p>
		<li>record goto n</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Go to instruction number n in the execution log.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_record save_0"><b>record save</b></a> filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Save the execution log to a file filename. Default filename is gdb_record.process_id, where process_id is the process ID of the inferior.
	</p>
	<p>
		This command may not be available for all recording methods.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_record restore_0"><b>record restore</b></a> filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Restore the execution log from a file filename. File must have been created with record save.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set record full insn-number-max_0"><b>set record full insn-number-max</b></a> limit</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set record full insn-number-max unlimited_0"><b>set record full insn-number-max unlimited</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the limit of instructions to be recorded for the full recording method. Default value is 200000.
	</p>
	<p>
		If limit is a positive number, then GDB will start deleting instructions from the log once the number of the record instructions becomes greater than limit. For every new recorded instruction, GDB will delete the earliest recorded instruction to keep the number of recorded instructions at the limit. (Since deleting recorded instructions loses information, GDB lets you control what happens when the limit is reached, by means of the stop&ndash;at&ndash;limit option, described below.)
	</p>
	<p>
		If limit is unlimited or zero, GDB will never delete recorded instructions from the execution log. The number of recorded instructions is limited only by the available memory.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show record full insn-number-max_0"><b>show record full insn-number-max</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the limit of instructions to be recorded with the full recording method.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set record full stop-at-limit_0"><b>set record full stop-at-limit</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the behavior of the full recording method when the number of recorded instructions reaches the limit. If ON (the default), GDB will stop when the limit is reached for the first time and ask you whether you want to stop the inferior or continue running it and recording the execution log. If you decide to continue recording, each new recorded instruction will cause the oldest one to be deleted.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this option is OFF, GDB will automatically delete the oldest record to make room for each new one, without asking.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show record full stop-at-limit_0"><b>show record full stop-at-limit</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of stop&ndash;at&ndash;limit.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set record full memory-query_0"><b>set record full memory-query</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the behavior when GDB is unable to record memory changes caused by an instruction for the full recording method. If ON, GDB will query whether to stop the inferior in that case.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this option is OFF (the default), GDB will automatically ignore the effect of such instructions on memory. Later, when GDB replays this execution log, it will mark the log of this instruction as not accessible, and it will not affect the replay results.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show record full memory-query_0"><b>show record full memory-query</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of memory&ndash;query.
	</p>
	<p>
		The btrace record target does not trace data. As a convenience, when replaying, GDB reads read&ndash;only memory off the live program directly, assuming that the addresses of the read&ndash;only areas don&rsquo;t change. This for example makes it possible to disassemble code while replaying, but not to print variables. In some cases, being able to inspect variables might be useful. You can use the following command for that:
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set record btrace replay-memory-access_0"><b>set record btrace replay-memory-access</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the behavior of the btrace recording method when accessing memory during replay. If read&ndash;only (the default), GDB will only allow accesses to read&ndash;only memory. If read&ndash;write, GDB will allow accesses to read&ndash;only and to read&ndash;write memory. Beware that the accessed memory corresponds to the live target and not necessarily to the current replay position.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set record btrace cpu identifier_0"><b>set record btrace cpu identifier</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the processor to be used for enabling workarounds for processor errata when decoding the trace.
	</p>
	<p>
		Processor errata are defects in processor operation, caused by its design or manufacture. They can cause a trace not to match the specification. This, in turn, may cause trace decode to fail. GDB can detect erroneous trace packets and correct them, thus avoiding the decoding failures. These corrections are known as errata workarounds, and are enabled based on the processor on which the trace was recorded.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, GDB attempts to detect the processor automatically, and apply the necessary workarounds for it. However, you may need to specify the processor if GDB does not yet support it. This command allows you to do that, and also allows to disable the workarounds.
	</p>
	<p>
		The argument identifier identifies the CPU and is of the form: vendor:processor identifier. In addition, there are two special identifiers, none and auto (default).
	</p>
	<p>
		The following vendor identifiers and corresponding processor identifiers are currently supported:
	</p>
	<pre><code>intel	family/model[/stepping]	</code></pre>
	<p>
		On GNU/Linux systems, the processor family, model, and stepping can be obtained from /proc/cpuinfo.
	</p>
	<p>
		If identifier is auto, enable errata workarounds for the processor on which the trace was recorded. If identifier is none, errata workarounds are disabled.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, when using an old GDB on a new system, decode may fail because GDB does not support the new processor. It often suffices to specify an older processor that GDB supports.

		Disassembles instructions from the recorded execution log. By default, ten instructions are disassembled. This can be changed using the set record instruction&ndash;history&ndash;size command. Instructions are printed in execution order.
	</p>
	<p>
		It can also print mixed source+disassembly if you specify the the /m or /s modifier, and print the raw instructions in hex as well as in symbolic form by specifying the /r or /b modifier. The behaviour of the /m, /s, /r, and /b modifiers are the same as for the disassemble command (see disassemble).
	</p>
	<p>
		The current position marker is printed for the instruction at the current program counter value. This instruction can appear multiple times in the trace and the current position marker will be printed every time. To omit the current position marker, specify the /p modifier.

	<p>
		To better align the printed instructions when the trace contains instructions from more than one function, the function name may be omitted by specifying the /f modifier.

For each sequence of instructions that belong to the same function, it prints the name of that function, the source lines for this instruction sequence (if the /l modifier is specified), and the instructions numbers that form the sequence (if the /i modifier is specified). The function names are indented to reflect the call stack depth if the /c modifier is specified. The /l, /i, and /c modifiers can be given together.

	<H1><a name="HEAD_dcbc3c2f" href="#TOC_HEAD_dcbc3c2f">8 Examining the Stack</a></H1>
<p>
	When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is where it stopped and how it got there.
</p>
<p>
	Each time your program performs a function call, information about the call is generated. That information includes the location of the call in your program, the arguments of the call, and the local variables of the function being called. The information is saved in a block of data called a stack frame. The stack frames are allocated in a region of memory called the call stack.
</p>
<p>
	When your program stops, the GDB commands for examining the stack allow you to see all of this information.
</p>
<p>
	One of the stack frames is selected by GDB and many GDB commands refer implicitly to the selected frame. In particular, whenever you ask GDB for the value of a variable in your program, the value is found in the selected frame. There are special GDB commands to select whichever frame you are interested in. See Selecting a Frame.
</p>
<p>
	When your program stops, GDB automatically selects the currently executing frame and describes it briefly, similar to the frame command (see Information about a Frame).
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_eb7b0983" href="#TOC_HEAD_eb7b0983">8.1 Stack Frames</a></H2>
<p>
	The call stack is divided up into contiguous pieces called stack frames, or frames for short; each frame is the data associated with one call to one function. The frame contains the arguments given to the function, the function&rsquo;s local variables, and the address at which the function is executing.
</p>
<p>
	When your program is started, the stack has only one frame, that of the function main. This is called the initial frame or the outermost frame. Each time a function is called, a new frame is made. Each time a function returns, the frame for that function invocation is eliminated. If a function is recursive, there can be many frames for the same function. The frame for the function in which execution is actually occurring is called the innermost frame. This is the most recently created of all the stack frames that still exist.
</p>
<p>
	Inside your program, stack frames are identified by their addresses. A stack frame consists of many bytes, each of which has its own address; each kind of computer has a convention for choosing one byte whose address serves as the address of the frame. Usually this address is kept in a register called the frame pointer register (see $fp) while execution is going on in that frame.
</p>
<p>
	GDB labels each existing stack frame with a level, a number that is zero for the innermost frame, one for the frame that called it, and so on upward. These level numbers give you a way of designating stack frames in GDB commands. The terms frame number and frame level can be used interchangeably to describe this number.
</p>
<p>
	Some compilers provide a way to compile functions so that they operate without stack frames. (For example, the GCC option
</p>
<pre><code>‘-fomit-frame-pointer’</code></pre>
<p>
	generates functions without a frame.) This is occasionally done with heavily used library functions to save the frame setup time. GDB has limited facilities for dealing with these function invocations. If the innermost function invocation has no stack frame, GDB nevertheless regards it as though it had a separate frame, which is numbered zero as usual, allowing correct tracing of the function call chain. However, GDB has no provision for frameless functions elsewhere in the stack.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_9eea7a39" href="#TOC_HEAD_9eea7a39">8.2 Backtraces</a></H2><ul><a href="../tags/backtrace.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>backtrace</a>&nbsp;</ul>
<p>
	A backtrace is a summary of how your program got where it is. It shows one line per frame, for many frames, starting with the currently executing frame (frame zero), followed by its caller (frame one), and on up the stack.
</p>
<p>
	To print a backtrace of the entire stack, use the backtrace command, or its alias bt. This command will print one line per frame for frames in the stack. By default, all stack frames are printed. You can stop the backtrace at any time by typing the system interrupt character, normally Ctrl&ndash;c.

<pre><code>backtrace [option]… [qualifier]… [count]
bt [option]… [qualifier]… [count]

Print the backtrace of the entire stack.

The optional count can be one of the following:

- n

Print only the innermost n frames, where n is a positive number.

- -n

Print only the outermost n frames, where n is a positive number.

Options:

- -full

Print the values of the local variables also. This can be combined with the optional count to limit the number of frames shown.

- -no-filters

Do not run Python frame filters on this backtrace. See Frame Filter API, for more information. Additionally use disable frame-filter all to turn off all frame filters. This is only relevant when GDB has been configured with Python support.

- -hide

A Python frame filter might decide to “elide” some frames. Normally such elided frames are still printed, but they are indented relative to the filtered frames that cause them to be elided. The -hide option causes elided frames to not be printed at all.

The backtrace command also supports a number of options that allow overriding relevant global print settings as set by set backtrace and set print subcommands:

- -past-main [on|off]

Set whether backtraces should continue past main. Related setting: set backtrace past-main.

- -past-entry [on|off]

Set whether backtraces should continue past the entry point of a program. Related setting: set backtrace past-entry.

- -entry-values no|only|preferred|if-needed|both|compact|default

Set printing of function arguments at function entry. Related setting: set print entry-values.

- -frame-arguments all|scalars|none

Set printing of non-scalar frame arguments. Related setting: set print frame-arguments.

- -raw-frame-arguments [on|off]

Set whether to print frame arguments in raw form. Related setting: set print raw-frame-arguments.

- -frame-info auto|source-line|location|source-and-location|location-and-address|short-location

Set printing of frame information. Related setting: set print frame-info.

The optional qualifier is maintained for backward compatibility. It can be one of the following:

- full

Equivalent to the -full option.

- no-filters

Equivalent to the -no-filters option.

- hide

Equivalent to the -hide option.</code></pre>
<p>
	The names where and info stack (abbreviated info s) are additional aliases for backtrace.
</p>
<p>
	In a multi&ndash;threaded program, GDB by default shows the backtrace only for the current thread. To display the backtrace for several or all of the threads, use the command thread apply (see thread apply). For example, if you type thread apply all backtrace, GDB will display the backtrace for all the threads; this is handy when you debug a core dump of a multi&ndash;threaded program.
</p>
<p>
	Each line in the backtrace shows the frame number and the function name. The program counter value is also shown&mdash;unless you use set print address off. The backtrace also shows the source file name and line number, as well as the arguments to the function. The program counter value is omitted if it is at the beginning of the code for that line number.
</p>
<p>
	Here is an example of a backtrace. It was made with the command &lsquo;bt 3&rsquo;, so it shows the innermost three frames.
</p>
<pre><code>#0  m4_traceon (obs=0x24eb0, argc=1, argv=0x2b8c8)
    at builtin.c:993
#1  0x6e38 in expand_macro (sym=0x2b600, data=...) at macro.c:242
#2  0x6840 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=177664, td=0xf7fffb08)
    at macro.c:71
(More stack frames follow...)</code></pre>
<p>
	The display for frame zero does not begin with a program counter value, indicating that your program has stopped at the beginning of the code for line 993 of builtin.c.
</p>
<p>
	The value of parameter data in frame 1 has been replaced by &hellip;. By default, GDB prints the value of a parameter only if it is a scalar (integer, pointer, enumeration, etc). See command set print frame&ndash;arguments in Print Settings for more details on how to configure the way function parameter values are printed. The command set print frame&ndash;info (see Print Settings) controls what frame information is printed.
</p>
<p>
	If your program was compiled with optimizations, some compilers will optimize away arguments passed to functions if those arguments are never used after the call. Such optimizations generate code that passes arguments through registers, but doesn&rsquo;t store those arguments in the stack frame. GDB has no way of displaying such arguments in stack frames other than the innermost one. Here&rsquo;s what such a backtrace might look like:
</p>
<pre><code>#0  m4_traceon (obs=0x24eb0, argc=1, argv=0x2b8c8)
    at builtin.c:993
#1  0x6e38 in expand_macro (sym=&lt;optimized out&gt;) at macro.c:242
#2  0x6840 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=&lt;optimized out&gt;, td=0xf7fffb08)
    at macro.c:71
(More stack frames follow...)</code></pre>
<p>
	The values of arguments that were not saved in their stack frames are shown as &lsquo;&lt;optimized out&gt;&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
	If you need to display the values of such optimized&ndash;out arguments, either deduce that from other variables whose values depend on the one you are interested in, or recompile without optimizations.
</p>
<p>
	Most programs have a standard user entry point&mdash;a place where system libraries and startup code transition into user code. For C this is main9. When GDB finds the entry function in a backtrace it will terminate the backtrace, to avoid tracing into highly system&ndash;specific (and generally uninteresting) code.
</p>
<p>
	If you need to examine the startup code, or limit the number of levels in a backtrace, you can change this behavior:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set backtrace past&ndash;main</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set backtrace past-main_0"><b>set backtrace past-main</b></a> on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Backtraces will continue past the user entry point.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set backtrace past-main_1"><b>set backtrace past-main</b></a> off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Backtraces will stop when they encounter the user entry point. This is the default.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show backtrace past-main_0"><b>show backtrace past-main</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current user entry point backtrace policy.
	</p>
	<li>set backtrace past&ndash;entry</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set backtrace past-entry_0"><b>set backtrace past-entry</b></a> on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Backtraces will continue past the internal entry point of an application. This entry point is encoded by the linker when the application is built, and is likely before the user entry point main (or equivalent) is called.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set backtrace past-entry_1"><b>set backtrace past-entry</b></a> off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Backtraces will stop when they encounter the internal entry point of an application. This is the default.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show backtrace past-entry_0"><b>show backtrace past-entry</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current internal entry point backtrace policy.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set backtrace limit_0"><b>set backtrace limit</b></a> n</li>
	<li>set backtrace limit 0</li>
	<li>set backtrace limit unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Limit the backtrace to n levels. A value of unlimited or zero means unlimited levels.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show backtrace_0"><b>show backtrace</b></a> limit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current limit on backtrace levels.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	You can control how file names are displayed.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set filename&ndash;display</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set filename-display_0"><b>set filename-display</b></a> relative</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display file names relative to the compilation directory. This is the default.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set filename-display basename_0"><b>set filename-display basename</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display only basename of a filename.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_set filename-display absolute_0"><b>set filename-display absolute</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display an absolute filename.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_show filename-display_0"><b>show filename-display</b></a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current way to display filenames.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_c284be91" href="#TOC_HEAD_c284be91">8.3 Selecting a Frame</a></H2>
<p>
	Most commands for examining the stack and other data in your program work on whichever stack frame is selected at the moment. Here are the commands for selecting a stack frame; all of them finish by printing a brief description of the stack frame just selected.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_frame_0"><b>frame</b></a> [ frame&ndash;selection&ndash;spec ]</li>
	<li>f [ frame&ndash;selection&ndash;spec ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The frame command allows different stack frames to be selected. The frame&ndash;selection&ndash;spec can be any of the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>num</li>
		<li>level num</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Select frame level num. Recall that frame zero is the innermost (currently executing) frame, frame one is the frame that called the innermost one, and so on. The highest level frame is usually the one for main.
		</p>
		<p>
			As this is the most common method of navigating the frame stack, the string level can be omitted. For example, the following two commands are equivalent:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) frame 3
(gdb) frame level 3		</code></pre>
		<li>address stack&ndash;address</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Select the frame with stack address stack&ndash;address. The stack&ndash;address for a frame can be seen in the output of info frame, for example:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) info frame
Stack level 1, frame at 0x7fffffffda30:
rip = 0x40066d in b (amd64-entry-value.cc:59); saved rip 0x4004c5
tail call frame, caller of frame at 0x7fffffffda30
source language c++.
Arglist at unknown address.
Locals at unknown address, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffda30		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The stack&ndash;address for this frame is 0x7fffffffda30 as indicated by the line:
		</p>
		<pre><code>Stack level 1, frame at 0x7fffffffda30:		</code></pre>
		<li>function function&ndash;name</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Select the stack frame for function function&ndash;name. If there are multiple stack frames for function function&ndash;name then the inner most stack frame is selected.
		</p>
		<li>view stack&ndash;address [ pc&ndash;addr ]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			View a frame that is not part of GDB&rsquo;s backtrace. The frame viewed has stack address stack&ndash;addr, and optionally, a program counter address of pc&ndash;addr.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is useful mainly if the chaining of stack frames has been damaged by a bug, making it impossible for GDB to assign numbers properly to all frames. In addition, this can be useful when your program has multiple stacks and switches between them.
		</p>
		<p>
			When viewing a frame outside the current backtrace using frame view then you can always return to the original stack using one of the previous stack frame selection instructions, for example frame level 0.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_up_0"><b>up</b></a> n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Move n frames up the stack; n defaults to 1. For positive numbers n, this advances toward the outermost frame, to higher frame numbers, to frames that have existed longer.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_down_0"><b>down</b></a> n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Move n frames down the stack; n defaults to 1. For positive numbers n, this advances toward the innermost frame, to lower frame numbers, to frames that were created more recently. You may abbreviate down as do.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	All of these commands end by printing two lines of output describing the frame. The first line shows the frame number, the function name, the arguments, and the source file and line number of execution in that frame. The second line shows the text of that source line.
</p>
<p>
	For example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) up
#1  0x22f0 in main (argc=1, argv=0xf7fffbf4, env=0xf7fffbfc)
    at env.c:10
10              read_input_file (argv[i]);</code></pre>
<p>
	After such a printout, the list command with no arguments prints ten lines centered on the point of execution in the frame. You can also edit the program at the point of execution with your favorite editing program by typing edit. See Printing Source Lines, for details.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_select-frame_0"><b>select-frame</b></a> [ frame&ndash;selection&ndash;spec ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The select&ndash;frame command is a variant of frame that does not display the new frame after selecting it. This command is intended primarily for use in GDB command scripts, where the output might be unnecessary and distracting. The frame&ndash;selection&ndash;spec is as for the frame command described in Selecting a Frame.
	</p>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_up-silently_0"><b>up-silently</b></a> n</li>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_down-silently_0"><b>down-silently</b></a> n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These two commands are variants of up and down, respectively; they differ in that they do their work silently, without causing display of the new frame. They are intended primarily for use in GDB command scripts, where the output might be unnecessary and distracting.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_2b85f965" href="#TOC_HEAD_2b85f965">8.4 Information About a Frame</a></H2>
<p>
	There are several other commands to print information about the selected stack frame.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>frame</li>
	<li>f</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When used without any argument, this command does not change which frame is selected, but prints a brief description of the currently selected stack frame. It can be abbreviated f. With an argument, this command is used to select a stack frame. See Selecting a Frame.
	</p>
	<li>info frame</li>
	<li>info f</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command prints a verbose description of the selected stack frame, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the address of the frame</li>
		<li>the address of the next frame down (called by this frame)</li>
		<li>the address of the next frame up (caller of this frame)</li>
		<li>the language in which the source code corresponding to this frame is written</li>
		<li>the address of the frame&rsquo;s arguments</li>
		<li>the address of the frame&rsquo;s local variables</li>
		<li>the program counter saved in it (the address of execution in the caller frame)</li>
		<li>which registers were saved in the frame</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<p>
		The verbose description is useful when something has gone wrong that has made the stack format fail to fit the usual conventions.
	</p>
	<li>info frame [ frame&ndash;selection&ndash;spec ]</li>
	<li>info f [ frame&ndash;selection&ndash;spec ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print a verbose description of the frame selected by frame&ndash;selection&ndash;spec. The frame&ndash;selection&ndash;spec is the same as for the frame command (see Selecting a Frame). The selected frame remains unchanged by this command.
	</p>
	<li>info args [&ndash;q]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the arguments of the selected frame, each on a separate line.
	</p>
	<p>
		The optional flag &lsquo;&ndash;q&rsquo;, which stands for &lsquo;quiet&rsquo;, disables printing header information and messages explaining why no argument have been printed.
	</p>
	<li>info args [&ndash;q] [&ndash;t type_regexp] [regexp]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like info args, but only print the arguments selected with the provided regexp(s).
	</p>
	<p>
		If regexp is provided, print only the arguments whose names match the regular expression regexp.
	</p>
	<p>
		If type_regexp is provided, print only the arguments whose types, as printed by the whatis command, match the regular expression type_regexp. If type_regexp contains space(s), it should be enclosed in quote characters. If needed, use backslash to escape the meaning of special characters or quotes.
	</p>
	<p>
		If both regexp and type_regexp are provided, an argument is printed only if its name matches regexp and its type matches type_regexp.
	</p>
	<li>info locals [&ndash;q]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the local variables of the selected frame, each on a separate line. These are all variables (declared either static or automatic) accessible at the point of execution of the selected frame.
	</p>
	<p>
		The optional flag &lsquo;&ndash;q&rsquo;, which stands for &lsquo;quiet&rsquo;, disables printing header information and messages explaining why no local variables have been printed.
	</p>
	<li>info locals [&ndash;q] [&ndash;t type_regexp] [regexp]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like info locals, but only print the local variables selected with the provided regexp(s).
	</p>
	<p>
		If regexp is provided, print only the local variables whose names match the regular expression regexp.
	</p>
	<p>
		If type_regexp is provided, print only the local variables whose types, as printed by the whatis command, match the regular expression type_regexp. If type_regexp contains space(s), it should be enclosed in quote characters. If needed, use backslash to escape the meaning of special characters or quotes.
	</p>
	<p>
		If both regexp and type_regexp are provided, a local variable is printed only if its name matches regexp and its type matches type_regexp.
	</p>
	<p>
		The command info locals &ndash;q &ndash;t type_regexp can usefully be combined with the commands frame apply and thread apply. For example, your program might use Resource Acquisition Is Initialization types (RAII) such as lock_something_t: each local variable of type lock_something_t automatically places a lock that is destroyed when the variable goes out of scope. You can then list all acquired locks in your program by doing
	</p>
	<pre><code>thread apply all -s frame apply all -s info locals -q -t lock_something_t	</code></pre>
	<p>
		or the equivalent shorter form
	</p>
	<pre><code>tfaas i lo -q -t lock_something_t	</code></pre>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_5e5bb1de" href="#TOC_HEAD_5e5bb1de">8.5 Applying a Command to Several Frames.</a></H2>
<ul>
	<li>frame apply [all | count | &ndash;count | level level&hellip;] [option]&hellip; command</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The frame apply command allows you to apply the named command to one or more frames.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>all</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Specify all to apply command to all frames.
		</p>
		<li>count</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Use count to apply command to the innermost count frames, where count is a positive number.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;count</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Use &ndash;count to apply command to the outermost count frames, where count is a positive number.
		</p>
		<li>level</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Use level to apply command to the set of frames identified by the level list. level is a frame level or a range of frame levels as level1&ndash;level2. The frame level is the number shown in the first field of the &lsquo;backtrace&rsquo; command output. E.g., &lsquo;2&ndash;4 6&ndash;8 3&rsquo; indicates to apply command for the frames at levels 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and then again on frame at level 3.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Note that the frames on which frame apply applies a command are also influenced by the set backtrace settings such as set backtrace past&ndash;main and set backtrace limit N. See Backtraces.
	</p>
	<p>
		The frame apply command also supports a number of options that allow overriding relevant set backtrace settings:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&ndash;past&ndash;main [on|off]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Whether backtraces should continue past main. Related setting: set backtrace past&ndash;main.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;past&ndash;entry [on|off]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Whether backtraces should continue past the entry point of a program. Related setting: set backtrace past&ndash;entry.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		By default, GDB displays some frame information before the output produced by command, and an error raised during the execution of a command will abort frame apply. The following options can be used to fine&ndash;tune these behaviors:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&ndash;c</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The flag &ndash;c, which stands for &lsquo;continue&rsquo;, causes any errors in command to be displayed, and the execution of frame apply then continues.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;s</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The flag &ndash;s, which stands for &lsquo;silent&rsquo;, causes any errors or empty output produced by a command to be silently ignored. That is, the execution continues, but the frame information and errors are not printed.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;q</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The flag &ndash;q (&lsquo;quiet&rsquo;) disables printing the frame information.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The following example shows how the flags &ndash;c and &ndash;s are working when applying the command p j to all frames, where variable j can only be successfully printed in the outermost #1 main frame.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) frame apply all p j
#0  some_function (i=5) at fun.c:4
No symbol "j" in current context.
(gdb) frame apply all -c p j
#0  some_function (i=5) at fun.c:4
No symbol "j" in current context.
#1  0x565555fb in main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd2c4) at fun.c:11
$1 = 5
(gdb) frame apply all -s p j
#1  0x565555fb in main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd2c4) at fun.c:11
$2 = 5
(gdb)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		By default, &lsquo;frame apply&rsquo;, prints the frame location information before the command output:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) frame apply all p $sp
#0  some_function (i=5) at fun.c:4
$4 = (void *) 0xffffd1e0
#1  0x565555fb in main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd2c4) at fun.c:11
$5 = (void *) 0xffffd1f0
(gdb)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If the flag &ndash;q is given, no frame information is printed:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) frame apply all -q p $sp
$12 = (void *) 0xffffd1e0
$13 = (void *) 0xffffd1f0
(gdb)	</code></pre>
	<li><a name="wd_ln_faas_0"><b>faas</b></a> command</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Shortcut for frame apply all &ndash;s command. Applies command on all frames, ignoring errors and empty output.
	</p>
	<p>
		It can for example be used to print a local variable or a function argument without knowing the frame where this variable or argument is, using:
	</p>
	<p>
		(gdb) faas p some_local_var_i_do_not_remember_where_it_is
	</p>
	<p>
		The faas command accepts the same options as the frame apply command. See frame apply.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the command tfaas command applies command on all frames of all threads. See See Threads.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_37cc9c32" href="#TOC_HEAD_37cc9c32">8.6 Management of Frame Filters.</a></H2>
<p>
	Frame filters are Python based utilities to manage and decorate the output of frames. See Frame Filter API, for further information.
</p>
<p>
	Managing frame filters is performed by several commands available within GDB, detailed here.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info frame&ndash;filter</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print a list of installed frame filters from all dictionaries, showing their name, priority and enabled status.
	</p>
	<li>disable frame&ndash;filter filter&ndash;dictionary filter&ndash;name</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable a frame filter in the dictionary matching filter&ndash;dictionary and filter&ndash;name. The filter&ndash;dictionary may be all, global, progspace, or the name of the object file where the frame filter dictionary resides. When all is specified, all frame filters across all dictionaries are disabled. The filter&ndash;name is the name of the frame filter and is used when all is not the option for filter&ndash;dictionary. A disabled frame&ndash;filter is not deleted, it may be enabled again later.
	</p>
	<li>enable frame&ndash;filter filter&ndash;dictionary filter&ndash;name</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable a frame filter in the dictionary matching filter&ndash;dictionary and filter&ndash;name. The filter&ndash;dictionary may be all, global, progspace or the name of the object file where the frame filter dictionary resides. When all is specified, all frame filters across all dictionaries are enabled. The filter&ndash;name is the name of the frame filter and is used when all is not the option for filter&ndash;dictionary.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info frame-filter

global frame-filters:
Priority  Enabled  Name
1000      No       PrimaryFunctionFilter
100       Yes      Reverse

100       Yes      ProgspaceFilter

objfile /build/test frame-filters:

<p>
	GDB can print parts of your program&rsquo;s source, since the debugging information recorded in the program tells GDB what source files were used to build it. When your program stops, GDB spontaneously prints the line where it stopped. Likewise, when you select a stack frame (see Selecting a Frame), GDB prints the line where execution in that frame has stopped. You can print other portions of source files by explicit command.
</p>
<p>
	If you use GDB through its GNU Emacs interface, you may prefer to use Emacs facilities to view source; see Using GDB under GNU Emacs.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_1108961" href="#TOC_HEAD_1108961">9.1 Printing Source Lines</a></H2>
<p>
	To print lines from a source file, use the list command (abbreviated l). By default, ten lines are printed. There are several ways to specify what part of the file you want to print; see Location Specifications, for the full list.
</p>
<p>
	Here are the forms of the list command most commonly used:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>list linenum</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print lines centered around line number linenum in the current source file.
	</p>
	<li>list function</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print lines centered around the beginning of function function.
	</p>
	<li>list</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print more lines. If the last lines printed were printed with a list command, this prints lines following the last lines printed; however, if the last line printed was a solitary line printed as part of displaying a stack frame (see Examining the Stack), this prints lines centered around that line.
	</p>
	<li>list &ndash;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print lines just before the lines last printed.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	By default, GDB prints ten source lines with any of these forms of the list command. You can change this using set listsize:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set listsize count</li>
	<li>set listsize unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Make the list command display count source lines (unless the list argument explicitly specifies some other number). Setting count to unlimited or 0 means there&rsquo;s no limit.
	</p>
	<li>show listsize</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the number of lines that list prints.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Repeating a list command with RET discards the argument, so it is equivalent to typing just list. This is more useful than listing the same lines again. An exception is made for an argument of &lsquo;&ndash;&rsquo;; that argument is preserved in repetition so that each repetition moves up in the source file.
</p>
<p>
	In general, the list command expects you to supply zero, one or two location specs. These location specs are interpreted to resolve to source code lines; there are several ways of writing them (see Location Specifications), but the effect is always to resolve to some source lines to display.
</p>
<p>
	Here is a complete description of the possible arguments for list:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>list locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print lines centered around the line or lines of all the code locations that result from resolving locspec.
	</p>
	<li>list first,last</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print lines from first to last. Both arguments are location specs. When a list command has two location specs, and the source file of the second location spec is omitted, this refers to the same source file as the first location spec. If either first or last resolve to more than one source line in the program, then the list command shows the list of resolved source lines and does not proceed with the source code listing.
	</p>
	<li>list ,last</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print lines ending with last.
	</p>
	<p>
		Likewise, if last resolves to more than one source line in the program, then the list command prints the list of resolved source lines and does not proceed with the source code listing.
	</p>
	<li>list first,</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print lines starting with first.
	</p>
	<li>list +</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print lines just after the lines last printed.
	</p>
	<li>list &ndash;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print lines just before the lines last printed.
	</p>
	<li>list</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		As described in the preceding table.

<p>
	Several GDB commands accept arguments that specify a location or locations of your program&rsquo;s code. Many times locations are specified using a source line number, but they can also be specified by a function name, an address, a label, etc. The different forms of specifying a location that GDB recognizes are collectively known as forms of location specification, or location spec. This section documents the forms of specifying locations that GDB recognizes.
</p>
<p>
	When you specify a location, GDB needs to find the place in your program, known as code location, that corresponds to the given location spec. We call this process of finding actual code locations corresponding to a location spec location resolution.
</p>
<p>
	A concrete code location in your program is uniquely identifiable by a set of several attributes: its source line number, the name of its source file, the fully&ndash;qualified and prototyped function in which it is defined, and an instruction address. Because each inferior has its own address space, the inferior number is also a necessary part of these attributes.
</p>
<p>
	By contrast, location specs you type will many times omit some of these attributes. For example, it is customary to specify just the source line number to mean a line in the current source file, or specify just the basename of the file, omitting its directories. In other words, a location spec is usually incomplete, a kind of blueprint, and GDB needs to complete the missing attributes by using the implied defaults, and by considering the source code and the debug information available to it. This is what location resolution is about.
</p>
<p>
	The resolution of an incomplete location spec can produce more than a single code location, if the spec doesn&rsquo;t allow distinguishing between them. Here are some examples of situations that result in a location spec matching multiple code locations in your program:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The location spec specifies a function name, and there are several functions in the program which have that name. (To distinguish between them, you can specify a fully&ndash;qualified and prototyped function name, such as A::func(int) instead of just func.)</li>
	<li>The location spec specifies a source file name, and there are several source files in the program that share the same name, for example several files with the same basename in different subdirectories. (To distinguish between them, specify enough leading directories with the file name.)</li>
	<li>For a C++ constructor, the GCC compiler generates several instances of the function body, used in different cases, but their source&ndash;level names are identical.</li>
	<li>For a C++ template function, a given line in the function can correspond to any number of instantiations.</li>
	<li>For an inlined function, a given source line can correspond to several actual code locations with that function&rsquo;s inlined code.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	Resolution of a location spec can also fail to produce a complete code location, or even fail to produce any code location. Here are some examples of such situations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some parts of the program lack detailed enough debug info, so the resolved code location lacks some attributes, like source file name and line number, leaving just the instruction address and perhaps also a function name. Such an incomplete code location is only usable in contexts that work with addresses and/or function names. Some commands can only work with complete code locations.</li>
	<li>The location spec specifies a function name, and there are no functions in the program by that name, or they only exist in a yet&ndash;unloaded shared library.</li>
	<li>The location spec specifies a source file name, and there are no source files in the program by that name, or they only exist in a yet&ndash;unloaded shared library.</li>
	<li>The location spec specifies both a source file name and a source line number, and even though there are source files in the program that match the file name, none of those files has the specified line number.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	Locations may be specified using three different formats: linespec locations, explicit locations, or address locations. The following subsections describe these formats.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_fe1d000d" href="#TOC_HEAD_fe1d000d">9.2.1 Linespec Locations</a></H3>
<p>
	A linespec is a colon&ndash;separated list of source location parameters such as file name, function name, etc. Here are all the different ways of specifying a linespec:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>linenum</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specifies the line number linenum of the current source file.
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;offset</li>
	<li>+offset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specifies the line offset lines before or after the current line. For the list command, the current line is the last one printed; for the breakpoint commands, this is the line at which execution stopped in the currently selected stack frame (see Frames, for a description of stack frames.) When used as the second of the two linespecs in a list command, this specifies the line offset lines up or down from the first linespec.
	</p>
	<li>filename:linenum</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specifies the line linenum in the source file filename. If filename is a relative file name, then it will match any source file name with the same trailing components. For example, if filename is &lsquo;gcc/expr.c&rsquo;, then it will match source file name of /build/trunk/gcc/expr.c, but not /build/trunk/libcpp/expr.c or /build/trunk/gcc/x&ndash;expr.c.
	</p>
	<li>function</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specifies the line that begins the body of the function function. For example, in C, this is the line with the open brace.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, in C++ and Ada, function is interpreted as specifying all functions named function in all scopes. For C++, this means in all namespaces and classes. For Ada, this means in all packages.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, assuming a program with C++ symbols named A::B::func and B::func, both commands break func and break B::func set a breakpoint on both symbols.
	</p>
	<p>
		Commands that accept a linespec let you override this with the &ndash;qualified option. For example, break &ndash;qualified func sets a breakpoint on a free&ndash;function named func ignoring any C++ class methods and namespace functions called func.
	</p>
	<p>
		See Explicit Locations.
	</p>
	<li>function:label</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specifies the line where label appears in function.
	</p>
	<li>filename:function</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specifies the line that begins the body of the function function in the file filename. You only need the file name with a function name to avoid ambiguity when there are identically named functions in different source files.
	</p>
	<li>label</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specifies the line at which the label named label appears in the function corresponding to the currently selected stack frame. If there is no current selected stack frame (for instance, if the inferior is not running), then GDB will not search for a label.
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;pstap|&ndash;probe&ndash;stap [objfile:[provider:]]name</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The GNU/Linux tool SystemTap provides a way for applications to embed static probes. See Static Probe Points, for more information on finding and using static probes. This form of linespec specifies the location of such a static probe.
	</p>
	<p>
		If objfile is given, only probes coming from that shared library or executable matching objfile as a regular expression are considered. If provider is given, then only probes from that provider are considered. If several probes match the spec, GDB will insert a breakpoint at each one of those probes.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_8a7e8cb1" href="#TOC_HEAD_8a7e8cb1">9.2.2 Explicit Locations</a></H3>
<p>
	Explicit locations allow the user to directly specify the source location&rsquo;s parameters using option&ndash;value pairs.
</p>
<p>
	Explicit locations are useful when several functions, labels, or file names have the same name (base name for files) in the program&rsquo;s sources. In these cases, explicit locations point to the source line you meant more accurately and unambiguously. Also, using explicit locations might be faster in large programs.
</p>
<p>
	For example, the linespec &lsquo;foo:bar&rsquo; may refer to a function bar defined in the file named foo or the label bar in a function named foo. GDB must search either the file system or the symbol table to know.
</p>
<p>
	The list of valid explicit location options is summarized in the following table:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>&ndash;source filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The value specifies the source file name. To differentiate between files with the same base name, prepend as many directories as is necessary to uniquely identify the desired file, e.g., foo/bar/baz.c. Otherwise GDB will use the first file it finds with the given base name. This option requires the use of either &ndash;function or &ndash;line.
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;function function</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The value specifies the name of a function. Operations on function locations unmodified by other options (such as &ndash;label or &ndash;line) refer to the line that begins the body of the function. In C, for example, this is the line with the open brace.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, in C++ and Ada, function is interpreted as specifying all functions named function in all scopes. For C++, this means in all namespaces and classes. For Ada, this means in all packages.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, assuming a program with C++ symbols named A::B::func and B::func, both commands break &ndash;function func and break &ndash;function B::func set a breakpoint on both symbols.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use the &ndash;qualified flag to override this (see below).
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;qualified</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This flag makes GDB interpret a function name specified with &ndash;function as a complete fully&ndash;qualified name.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, assuming a C++ program with symbols named A::B::func and B::func, the break &ndash;qualified &ndash;function B::func command sets a breakpoint on B::func, only.
	</p>
	<p>
		(Note: the &ndash;qualified option can precede a linespec as well (see Linespec Locations), so the particular example above could be simplified as break &ndash;qualified B::func.)
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;label label</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The value specifies the name of a label. When the function name is not specified, the label is searched in the function of the currently selected stack frame.
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;line number</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The value specifies a line offset for the location. The offset may either be absolute (&ndash;line 3) or relative (&ndash;line +3), depending on the command. When specified without any other options, the line offset is relative to the current line.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Explicit location options may be abbreviated by omitting any non&ndash;unique trailing characters from the option name, e.g., break &ndash;s main.c &ndash;li 3.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_c249f394" href="#TOC_HEAD_c249f394">9.2.3 Address Locations</a></H3>
<p>
	Address locations indicate a specific program address. They have the generalized form *address.
</p>
<p>
	For line&ndash;oriented commands, such as list and edit, this specifies a source line that contains address. For break and other breakpoint&ndash;oriented commands, this can be used to set breakpoints in parts of your program which do not have debugging information or source files.
</p>
<p>
	Here address may be any expression valid in the current working language (see working language) that specifies a code address. In addition, as a convenience, GDB extends the semantics of expressions used in locations to cover several situations that frequently occur during debugging. Here are the various forms of address:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Any expression valid in the current working language.
	</p>
	<li>funcaddr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		An address of a function or procedure derived from its name. In C, C++, Objective&ndash;C, Fortran, minimal, and assembly, this is simply the function&rsquo;s name function (and actually a special case of a valid expression). In Pascal and Modula&ndash;2, this is &amp;function. In Ada, this is function&#039;Address (although the Pascal form also works).
	</p>
	<p>
		This form specifies the address of the function&rsquo;s first instruction, before the stack frame and arguments have been set up.
	</p>
	<li>&#039;filename&#039;:funcaddr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like funcaddr above, but also specifies the name of the source file explicitly. This is useful if the name of the function does not specify the function unambiguously, e.g., if there are several functions with identical names in different source files.
	</p>
</ul>

</menu>

</div>
<p>
	To edit the lines in a source file, use the edit command. The editing program of your choice is invoked with the current line set to the active line in the program. Alternatively, there are several ways to specify what part of the file you want to print if you want to see other parts of the program:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>edit locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Edit the source file of the code location that results from resolving locspec. Editing starts at the source file and source line locspec resolves to. See Location Specifications, for all the possible forms of the locspec argument.
	</p>
	<p>
		If locspec resolves to more than one source line in your program, then the command prints the list of resolved source lines and does not proceed with the editing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here are the forms of the edit command most commonly used:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>edit number</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Edit the current source file with number as the active line number.
		</p>
		<li>edit function</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Edit the file containing function at the beginning of its definition.
		</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_faf0c1ed" href="#TOC_HEAD_faf0c1ed">9.3.1 Choosing your Editor</a></H3>
<p>
	You can customize GDB to use any editor you want 10. By default, it is /bin/ex, but you can change this by setting the environment variable EDITOR before using GDB. For example, to configure GDB to use the vi editor, you could use these commands with the sh shell:
</p>
<pre><code>EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi
export EDITOR
gdb …</code></pre>
<p>
	or in the csh shell,
</p>
<pre><code>setenv EDITOR /usr/bin/vi
gdb …</code></pre>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_2afdb8f9" href="#TOC_HEAD_2afdb8f9">9.4 Searching Source Files</a></H2>
<p>
	There are two commands for searching through the current source file for a regular expression.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>forward&ndash;search regexp</li>
	<li>search regexp</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The command &lsquo;forward&ndash;search regexp&rsquo; checks each line, starting with the one following the last line listed, for a match for regexp. It lists the line that is found. You can use the synonym &lsquo;search regexp&rsquo; or abbreviate the command name as fo.
	</p>
	<li>reverse&ndash;search regexp</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The command &lsquo;reverse&ndash;search regexp&rsquo; checks each line, starting with the one before the last line listed and going backward, for a match for regexp. It lists the line that is found. You can abbreviate this command as rev.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_6732f265" href="#TOC_HEAD_6732f265">9.5 Specifying Source Directories</a></H2>
<p>
	Executable programs sometimes do not record the directories of the source files from which they were compiled, just the names. Even when they do, the directories could be moved between the compilation and your debugging session. GDB has a list of directories to search for source files; this is called the source path. Each time GDB wants a source file, it tries all the directories in the list, in the order they are present in the list, until it finds a file with the desired name.
</p>
<p>
	For example, suppose an executable references the file /usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c, does not record a compilation directory, and the source path is /mnt/cross. GDB would look for the source file in the following locations:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/mnt/cross/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/mnt/cross/foo.c</li>
	<br />
</ol>
<p>
	If the source file is not present at any of the above locations then an error is printed. GDB does not look up the parts of the source file name, such as /mnt/cross/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c. Likewise, the subdirectories of the source path are not searched: if the source path is /mnt/cross, and the binary refers to foo.c, GDB would not find it under /mnt/cross/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib.
</p>
<p>
	Plain file names, relative file names with leading directories, file names containing dots, etc. are all treated as described above, except that non&ndash;absolute file names are not looked up literally. If the source path is /mnt/cross, the source file is recorded as ../lib/foo.c, and no compilation directory is recorded, then GDB will search in the following locations:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>/mnt/cross/../lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/mnt/cross/foo.c</li>
	<br />
</ol>
<p>
	The source path will always include two special entries &lsquo;$cdir&rsquo; and &lsquo;$cwd&rsquo;, these refer to the compilation directory (if one is recorded) and the current working directory respectively.
</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;$cdir&rsquo; causes GDB to search within the compilation directory, if one is recorded in the debug information. If no compilation directory is recorded in the debug information then &lsquo;$cdir&rsquo; is ignored.
</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;$cwd&rsquo; is not the same as &lsquo;.&rsquo;&mdash;the former tracks the current working directory as it changes during your GDB session, while the latter is immediately expanded to the current directory at the time you add an entry to the source path.
</p>
<p>
	If a compilation directory is recorded in the debug information, and GDB has not found the source file after the first search using source path, then GDB will combine the compilation directory and the filename, and then search for the source file again using the source path.
</p>
<p>
	For example, if the executable records the source file as /usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c, the compilation directory is recorded as /project/build, and the source path is /mnt/cross:$cdir:$cwd while the current working directory of the GDB session is /home/user, then GDB will search for the source file in the following locations:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/mnt/cross/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/project/build/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/home/user/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/mnt/cross/project/build/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/project/build/project/build/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/home/user/project/build/usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c</li>
	<li>/mnt/cross/foo.c</li>
	<li>/project/build/foo.c</li>
	<li>/home/user/foo.c</li>
	<br />
</ol>
<p>
	If the file name in the previous example had been recorded in the executable as a relative path rather than an absolute path, then the first look up would not have occurred, but all of the remaining steps would be similar.
</p>
<p>
	When searching for source files on MS&ndash;DOS and MS&ndash;Windows, where absolute paths start with a drive letter (e.g. C:/project/foo.c), GDB will remove the drive letter from the file name before appending it to a search directory from source path; for instance if the executable references the source file C:/project/foo.c and source path is set to D:/mnt/cross, then GDB will search in the following locations for the source file:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>C:/project/foo.c</li>
	<li>D:/mnt/cross/project/foo.c</li>
	<li>D:/mnt/cross/foo.c</li>
	<br />
</ol>
<p>
	Note that the executable search path is not used to locate the source files.
</p>
<p>
	Whenever you reset or rearrange the source path, GDB clears out any information it has cached about where source files are found and where each line is in the file.
</p>
<p>
	When you start GDB, its source path includes only &lsquo;$cdir&rsquo; and &lsquo;$cwd&rsquo;, in that order. To add other directories, use the directory command.
</p>
<p>
	The search path is used to find both program source files and GDB script files (read using the &lsquo;&ndash;command&rsquo; option and &lsquo;source&rsquo; command).
</p>
<p>
	In addition to the source path, GDB provides a set of commands that manage a list of source path substitution rules. A substitution rule specifies how to rewrite source directories stored in the program&rsquo;s debug information in case the sources were moved to a different directory between compilation and debugging. A rule is made of two strings, the first specifying what needs to be rewritten in the path, and the second specifying how it should be rewritten. In set substitute&ndash;path, we name these two parts from and to respectively. GDB does a simple string replacement of from with to at the start of the directory part of the source file name, and uses that result instead of the original file name to look up the sources.
</p>
<p>
	Using the previous example, suppose the foo&ndash;1.0 tree has been moved from /usr/src to /mnt/cross, then you can tell GDB to replace /usr/src in all source path names with /mnt/cross. The first lookup will then be /mnt/cross/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c in place of the original location of /usr/src/foo&ndash;1.0/lib/foo.c. To define a source path substitution rule, use the set substitute&ndash;path command (see set substitute&ndash;path).
</p>
<p>
	To avoid unexpected substitution results, a rule is applied only if the from part of the directory name ends at a directory separator. For instance, a rule substituting /usr/source into /mnt/cross will be applied to /usr/source/foo&ndash;1.0 but not to /usr/sourceware/foo&ndash;2.0. And because the substitution is applied only at the beginning of the directory name, this rule will not be applied to /root/usr/source/baz.c either.
</p>
<p>
	In many cases, you can achieve the same result using the directory command. However, set substitute&ndash;path can be more efficient in the case where the sources are organized in a complex tree with multiple subdirectories. With the directory command, you need to add each subdirectory of your project. If you moved the entire tree while preserving its internal organization, then set substitute&ndash;path allows you to direct the debugger to all the sources with one single command.
</p>
<p>
	set substitute&ndash;path is also more than just a shortcut command. The source path is only used if the file at the original location no longer exists. On the other hand, set substitute&ndash;path modifies the debugger behavior to look at the rewritten location instead. So, if for any reason a source file that is not relevant to your executable is located at the original location, a substitution rule is the only method available to point GDB at the new location.
</p>
<p>
	You can configure a default source path substitution rule by configuring GDB with the &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;relocated&ndash;sources=dir&rsquo; option. The dir should be the name of a directory under GDB&rsquo;s configured prefix (set with &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;prefix&rsquo; or &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;exec&ndash;prefix&rsquo;), and directory names in debug information under dir will be adjusted automatically if the installed GDB is moved to a new location. This is useful if GDB, libraries or executables with debug information and corresponding source code are being moved together.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>directory dirname &hellip;</li>
	<li>dir dirname &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Add directory dirname to the front of the source path. Several directory names may be given to this command, separated by &lsquo;:&rsquo; (&lsquo;;&rsquo; on MS&ndash;DOS and MS&ndash;Windows, where &lsquo;:&rsquo; usually appears as part of absolute file names) or whitespace. You may specify a directory that is already in the source path; this moves it forward, so GDB searches it sooner.
	</p>
	<p>
		The special strings &lsquo;$cdir&rsquo; (to refer to the compilation directory, if one is recorded), and &lsquo;$cwd&rsquo; (to refer to the current working directory) can also be included in the list of directories dirname. Though these will already be in the source path they will be moved forward in the list so GDB searches them sooner.
	</p>
	<li>directory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Reset the source path to its default value (&lsquo;$cdir:$cwd&rsquo; on Unix systems). This requires confirmation.
	</p>
	<li>set directories path&ndash;list</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the source path to path&ndash;list. &lsquo;$cdir:$cwd&rsquo; are added if missing.
	</p>
	<li>show directories</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the source path: show which directories it contains.
	</p>
	<li>set substitute&ndash;path from to</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Define a source path substitution rule, and add it at the end of the current list of existing substitution rules. If a rule with the same from was already defined, then the old rule is also deleted.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, if the file /foo/bar/baz.c was moved to /mnt/cross/baz.c, then the command
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) set substitute-path /foo/bar /mnt/cross	</code></pre>
	<p>
		will tell GDB to replace &lsquo;/foo/bar&rsquo; with &lsquo;/mnt/cross&rsquo;, which will allow GDB to find the file baz.c even though it was moved.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the case when more than one substitution rule have been defined, the rules are evaluated one by one in the order where they have been defined. The first one matching, if any, is selected to perform the substitution.
	</p>
	<p>
		For instance, if we had entered the following commands:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/include /mnt/include
(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src /mnt/src	</code></pre>
	<p>
		GDB would then rewrite /usr/src/include/defs.h into /mnt/include/defs.h by using the first rule. However, it would use the second rule to rewrite /usr/src/lib/foo.c into /mnt/src/lib/foo.c.
	</p>
	<li>unset substitute&ndash;path [path]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If a path is specified, search the current list of substitution rules for a rule that would rewrite that path. Delete that rule if found. A warning is emitted by the debugger if no rule could be found.
	</p>
	<p>
		If no path is specified, then all substitution rules are deleted.
	</p>
	<li>show substitute&ndash;path [path]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If a path is specified, then print the source path substitution rule which would rewrite that path, if any.
	</p>
	<p>
		If no path is specified, then print all existing source path substitution rules.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If your source path is cluttered with directories that are no longer of interest, GDB may sometimes cause confusion by finding the wrong versions of source. You can correct the situation as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use directory with no argument to reset the source path to its default value.</li>
	<li>Use directory with suitable arguments to reinstall the directories you want in the source path. You can add all the directories in one command.</li>
	<br />
</ol>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_8393cff5" href="#TOC_HEAD_8393cff5">9.6 Source and Machine Code</a></H2>
<p>
	You can use the command info line to map source lines to program addresses (and vice versa), and the command disassemble to display a range of addresses as machine instructions. You can use the command set disassemble&ndash;next&ndash;line to set whether to disassemble next source line when execution stops. When run under GNU Emacs mode, the info line command causes the arrow to point to the line specified. Also, info line prints addresses in symbolic form as well as hex.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info line</li>
	<li>info line locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the starting and ending addresses of the compiled code for the source lines of the code locations that result from resolving locspec. See Location Specifications, for the various forms of locspec. With no locspec, information about the current source line is printed.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	For example, we can use info line to discover the location of the object code for the first line of function m4_changequote:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info line m4_changequote
Line 895 of "builtin.c" starts at pc 0x634c &lt;m4_changequote&gt; and \
        ends at 0x6350 &lt;m4_changequote+4&gt;.</code></pre>
<p>
	We can also inquire, using *addr as the form for locspec, what source line covers a particular address addr:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info line *0x63ff
Line 926 of "builtin.c" starts at pc 0x63e4 &lt;m4_changequote+152&gt; and \
        ends at 0x6404 &lt;m4_changequote+184&gt;.</code></pre>
<p>
	After info line, the default address for the x command is changed to the starting address of the line, so that &lsquo;x/i&rsquo; is sufficient to begin examining the machine code (see Examining Memory). Also, this address is saved as the value of the convenience variable $_ (see Convenience Variables).
</p>
<p>
	After info line, using info line again without specifying a location will display information about the next source line.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>disassemble</li>
	<li>disassemble /m</li>
	<li>disassemble /s</li>
	<li>disassemble /r</li>
	<li>disassemble /b</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This specialized command dumps a range of memory as machine instructions. It can also print mixed source+disassembly by specifying the /m or /s modifier and print the raw instructions in hex as well as in symbolic form by specifying the /r or /b modifier. The default memory range is the function surrounding the program counter of the selected frame. A single argument to this command is a program counter value; GDB dumps the function surrounding this value. When two arguments are given, they should be separated by a comma, possibly surrounded by whitespace. The arguments specify a range of addresses to dump, in one of two forms:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>start,end</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			the addresses from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive)
		</p>
		<li>start,+length</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			the addresses from start (inclusive) to start+length (exclusive).
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When 2 arguments are specified, the name of the function is also printed (since there could be several functions in the given range).
	</p>
	<p>
		The argument(s) can be any expression yielding a numeric value, such as &lsquo;0x32c4&rsquo;, &lsquo;&amp;main+10&rsquo; or &lsquo;$pc &ndash; 8&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the range of memory being disassembled contains current program counter, the instruction at that location is shown with a =&gt; marker.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The following example shows the disassembly of a range of addresses of HP PA&ndash;RISC 2.0 code:
</p>

	The following two examples are for RISC&ndash;V, and demonstrates the difference between the /r and /b modifiers. First with /b, the bytes of the instruction are printed, in hex, in memory order:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) disassemble /b 0x00010150,0x0001015c
Dump of assembler code from 0x10150 to 0x1015c:

End of assembler dump.</code></pre>
<p>
	In contrast, with /r the bytes of the instruction are displayed in the instruction order, for RISC&ndash;V this means that the bytes have been swapped to little&ndash;endian order:

	The /m option is deprecated as its output is not useful when there is either inlined code or re&ndash;ordered code. The /s option is the preferred choice. Here is an example for AMD x86&ndash;64 showing the difference between /m output and /s output. This example has one inline function defined in a header file, and the code is compiled with &lsquo;&ndash;O2&rsquo; optimization. Note how the /m output is missing the disassembly of several instructions that are present in the /s output.

If the next source line cannot be displayed for some reason (e.g., if GDB cannot find the source file, or there&rsquo;s no line info in the debug info), GDB will display disassembly of the next instruction instead of showing the next source line. If AUTO, GDB will display disassembly of next instruction only if the source line cannot be displayed. This setting causes GDB to display some feedback when you step through a function with no line info or whose source file is unavailable. The default is OFF, which means never display the disassembly of the next line or instruction.

</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_fa97be68" href="#TOC_HEAD_fa97be68">9.7 Disable Reading Source Code</a></H2>
<p>
	In some cases it can be desirable to prevent GDB from accessing source code files. One case where this might be desirable is if the source code files are located over a slow network connection.
</p>
<p>
	The following command can be used to control whether GDB should access source code files or not:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set source open [on|off]</li>
	<li>show source open</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When this option is on, which is the default, GDB will access source code files when needed, for example to print source lines when GDB stops, or in response to the list command.

	<p>
		When this option is off, GDB will not access source code files.

	<H1><a name="HEAD_e4a2fb0d" href="#TOC_HEAD_e4a2fb0d">10 Examining Data</a></H1>
<p>
	The usual way to examine data in your program is with the print command (abbreviated p), or its synonym inspect. It evaluates and prints the value of an expression of the language your program is written in (see Using GDB with Different Languages). It may also print the expression using a Python&ndash;based pretty&ndash;printer (see Pretty Printing).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>print [[options] &ndash;&ndash;] expr</li>
	<li>print [[options] &ndash;&ndash;] /f expr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		expr is an expression (in the source language). By default the value of expr is printed in a format appropriate to its data type; you can choose a different format by specifying &lsquo;/f&rsquo;, where f is a letter specifying the format; see Output Formats.
	</p>
	<p>
		The print command supports a number of options that allow overriding relevant global print settings as set by set print subcommands:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&ndash;address [on|off]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set printing of addresses. Related setting: set print address.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;array [on|off]</li>

			Set printing of array indexes. Related setting: set print array&ndash;indexes.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;characters number&ndash;of&ndash;characters|elements|unlimited</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set limit on string characters to print. The value elements causes the limit on array elements to print to be used. The value unlimited causes there to be no limit. Related setting: set print characters.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;elements number&ndash;of&ndash;elements|unlimited</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set limit on array elements and optionally string characters to print. See set print characters, and the &ndash;characters option above for when this option applies to strings. The value unlimited causes there to be no limit. See set print elements, for a related CLI command.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;max&ndash;depth depth|unlimited</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set the threshold after which nested structures are replaced with ellipsis. Related setting: set print max&ndash;depth.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;nibbles [on|off]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set whether to print binary values in groups of four bits, known as &ldquo;nibbles&rdquo;. See set print nibbles.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;memory&ndash;tag&ndash;violations [on|off]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set printing of additional information about memory tag violations. See set print memory&ndash;tag&ndash;violations.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;null&ndash;stop [on|off]</li>

		<p>
			Set printing of char arrays to stop at first null char. Related setting: set print null&ndash;stop.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;object [on|off]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set printing C++ virtual function tables. Related setting: set print object.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;pretty [on|off]</li>

			Set pretty formatting of structures. Related setting: set print pretty.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;raw&ndash;values [on|off]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set whether to print values in raw form, bypassing any pretty&ndash;printers for that value. Related setting: set print raw&ndash;values.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;repeats number&ndash;of&ndash;repeats|unlimited</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set threshold for repeated print elements. unlimited causes all elements to be individually printed. Related setting: set print repeats.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;static&ndash;members [on|off]</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Set printing C++ static members. Related setting: set print static&ndash;members.
		</p>

		<br />
		<p>
			Set printing of C++ virtual function tables. Related setting: set print vtbl.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Because the print command accepts arbitrary expressions which may look like options (including abbreviations), if you specify any command option, then you must use a double dash (&ndash;&ndash;) to mark the end of option processing.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, this prints the value of the &ndash;p expression:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) print -p	</code></pre>
	<p>
		While this repeats the last value in the value history (see below) with the &ndash;pretty option in effect:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) print -p --	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Here is an example including both on option and an expression:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) print -pretty -- *myptr
$1 = {
next = 0x0,
flags = {
    sweet = 1,
    sour = 1
},
meat = 0x54 "Pork"
}	</code></pre>
	<li>print [options]</li>
	<li>print [options] /f</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If you omit expr, GDB displays the last value again (from the value history; see Value History). This allows you to conveniently inspect the same value in an alternative format.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If the architecture supports memory tagging, the print command will display pointer/memory tag mismatches if what is being printed is a pointer or reference type. See Memory Tagging.
</p>
<p>
	A more low&ndash;level way of examining data is with the x command. It examines data in memory at a specified address and prints it in a specified format. See Examining Memory.
</p>
<p>
	If you are interested in information about types, or about how the fields of a struct or a class are declared, use the ptype expr command rather than print. See Examining the Symbol Table.
</p>
<p>
	Another way of examining values of expressions and type information is through the Python extension command explore (available only if the GDB build is configured with &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;python). It offers an interactive way to start at the highest level (or, the most abstract level) of the data type of an expression (or, the data type itself) and explore all the way down to leaf scalar values/fields embedded in the higher level data types.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>explore arg</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		arg is either an expression (in the source language), or a type visible in the current context of the program being debugged.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The working of the explore command can be illustrated with an example. If a data type struct ComplexStruct is defined in your C program as
</p>
<pre><code>struct SimpleStruct
{
int i;
double d;
};

struct ComplexStruct
{
struct SimpleStruct *ss_p;
int arr[10];
};</code></pre>
<p>
	followed by variable declarations as
</p>
<pre><code>struct SimpleStruct ss = { 10, 1.11 };
struct ComplexStruct cs = { &ss, { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 } };</code></pre>
<p>
	then, the value of the variable cs can be explored using the explore command as follows.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) explore cs
The value of `cs' is a struct/class of type `struct ComplexStruct' with
the following fields:

ss_p = &lt;Enter 0 to explore this field of type `struct SimpleStruct *'&gt;
arr = &lt;Enter 1 to explore this field of type `int [10]'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	Enter the field number of choice:
</p>
<p>
	Since the fields of cs are not scalar values, you are being prompted to chose the field you want to explore. Let&rsquo;s say you choose the field ss_p by entering 0. Then, since this field is a pointer, you will be asked if it is pointing to a single value. From the declaration of cs above, it is indeed pointing to a single value, hence you enter y. If you enter n, then you will be asked if it were pointing to an array of values, in which case this field will be explored as if it were an array.
</p>
<pre><code>`cs.ss_p' is a pointer to a value of type `struct SimpleStruct'
Continue exploring it as a pointer to a single value [y/n]: y
The value of `*(cs.ss_p)' is a struct/class of type `struct
SimpleStruct' with the following fields:

i = 10 .. (Value of type `int')
d = 1.1100000000000001 .. (Value of type `double')

Press enter to return to parent value:</code></pre>
<p>
	If the field arr of cs was chosen for exploration by entering 1 earlier, then since it is as array, you will be prompted to enter the index of the element in the array that you want to explore.
</p>
<pre><code>`cs.arr' is an array of `int'.
Enter the index of the element you want to explore in `cs.arr': 5

`(cs.arr)[5]' is a scalar value of type `int'.

(cs.arr)[5] = 4

Press enter to return to parent value:</code></pre>
<p>
	In general, at any stage of exploration, you can go deeper towards the leaf values by responding to the prompts appropriately, or hit the return key to return to the enclosing data structure (the higher level data structure).
</p>
<p>
	Similar to exploring values, you can use the explore command to explore types. Instead of specifying a value (which is typically a variable name or an expression valid in the current context of the program being debugged), you specify a type name. If you consider the same example as above, your can explore the type struct ComplexStruct by passing the argument struct ComplexStruct to the explore command.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) explore struct ComplexStruct</code></pre>
<p>
	By responding to the prompts appropriately in the subsequent interactive session, you can explore the type struct ComplexStruct in a manner similar to how the value cs was explored in the above example.
</p>
<p>
	The explore command also has two sub&ndash;commands, explore value and explore type. The former sub&ndash;command is a way to explicitly specify that value exploration of the argument is being invoked, while the latter is a way to explicitly specify that type exploration of the argument is being invoked.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>explore value expr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This sub&ndash;command of explore explores the value of the expression expr (if expr is an expression valid in the current context of the program being debugged). The behavior of this command is identical to that of the behavior of the explore command being passed the argument expr.
	</p>
	<li>explore type arg</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This sub&ndash;command of explore explores the type of arg (if arg is a type visible in the current context of program being debugged), or the type of the value/expression arg (if arg is an expression valid in the current context of the program being debugged). If arg is a type, then the behavior of this command is identical to that of the explore command being passed the argument arg. If arg is an expression, then the behavior of this command will be identical to that of the explore command being passed the type of arg as the argument.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_a712f1bd" href="#TOC_HEAD_a712f1bd">10.1 Expressions</a></H2>
<p>
	print and many other GDB commands accept an expression and compute its value. Any kind of constant, variable or operator defined by the programming language you are using is valid in an expression in GDB. This includes conditional expressions, function calls, casts, and string constants. It also includes preprocessor macros, if you compiled your program to include this information; see Compilation.
</p>
<p>
	GDB supports array constants in expressions input by the user. The syntax is {element, element&hellip;}. For example, you can use the command print {1, 2, 3} to create an array of three integers. If you pass an array to a function or assign it to a program variable, GDB copies the array to memory that is malloced in the target program.
</p>
<p>
	Because C is so widespread, most of the expressions shown in examples in this manual are in C. See Using GDB with Different Languages, for information on how to use expressions in other languages.
</p>
<p>
	In this section, we discuss operators that you can use in GDB expressions regardless of your programming language.
</p>
<p>
	Casts are supported in all languages, not just in C, because it is so useful to cast a number into a pointer in order to examine a structure at that address in memory.
</p>
<p>
	GDB supports these operators, in addition to those common to programming languages:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>@</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		&lsquo;@&rsquo; is a binary operator for treating parts of memory as arrays. See Artificial Arrays, for more information.
	</p>
	<li>::</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		&lsquo;::&rsquo; allows you to specify a variable in terms of the file or function where it is defined. See Program Variables.
	</p>
	<li>{type} addr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Refers to an object of type type stored at address addr in memory. The address addr may be any expression whose value is an integer or pointer (but parentheses are required around binary operators, just as in a cast). This construct is allowed regardless of what kind of data is normally supposed to reside at addr.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_2d98004a" href="#TOC_HEAD_2d98004a">10.2 Ambiguous Expressions</a></H2>
<p>
	Expressions can sometimes contain some ambiguous elements. For instance, some programming languages (notably Ada, C++ and Objective&ndash;C) permit a single function name to be defined several times, for application in different contexts. This is called overloading. Another example involving Ada is generics. A generic package is similar to C++ templates and is typically instantiated several times, resulting in the same function name being defined in different contexts.
</p>
<p>
	In some cases and depending on the language, it is possible to adjust the expression to remove the ambiguity. For instance in C++, you can specify the signature of the function you want to break on, as in break function(types). In Ada, using the fully qualified name of your function often makes the expression unambiguous as well.
</p>
<p>
	When an ambiguity that needs to be resolved is detected, the debugger has the capability to display a menu of numbered choices for each possibility, and then waits for the selection with the prompt &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;. The first option is always &lsquo;[0] cancel&rsquo;, and typing 0 RET aborts the current command. If the command in which the expression was used allows more than one choice to be selected, the next option in the menu is &lsquo;[1] all&rsquo;, and typing 1 RET selects all possible choices.
</p>
<p>
	For example, the following session excerpt shows an attempt to set a breakpoint at the overloaded symbol String::after. We choose three particular definitions of that function name:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) b String::after
[0] cancel
[1] all
[2] file:String.cc; line number:867
[3] file:String.cc; line number:860
[4] file:String.cc; line number:875
[5] file:String.cc; line number:853
[6] file:String.cc; line number:846
[7] file:String.cc; line number:735
&gt; 2 4 6
Breakpoint 1 at 0xb26c: file String.cc, line 867.
Breakpoint 2 at 0xb344: file String.cc, line 875.
Breakpoint 3 at 0xafcc: file String.cc, line 846.
Multiple breakpoints were set.
Use the "delete" command to delete unwanted
breakpoints.
(gdb)</code></pre>
<ul>
	<li>set multiple&ndash;symbols mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This option allows you to adjust the debugger behavior when an expression is ambiguous.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, mode is set to all. If the command with which the expression is used allows more than one choice, then GDB automatically selects all possible choices. For instance, inserting a breakpoint on a function using an ambiguous name results in a breakpoint inserted on each possible match. However, if a unique choice must be made, then GDB uses the menu to help you disambiguate the expression. For instance, printing the address of an overloaded function will result in the use of the menu.
	</p>
	<p>
		When mode is set to ask, the debugger always uses the menu when an ambiguity is detected.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, when mode is set to cancel, the debugger reports an error due to the ambiguity and the command is aborted.
	</p>
	<li>show multiple&ndash;symbols</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current value of the multiple&ndash;symbols setting.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_46b0cd9f" href="#TOC_HEAD_46b0cd9f">10.3 Program Variables</a></H2>
<p>
	The most common kind of expression to use is the name of a variable in your program.
</p>
<p>
	Variables in expressions are understood in the selected stack frame (see Selecting a Frame); they must be either:
</p>
<pre><code>global (or file-static)</code></pre>
<p>
	or
</p>
<pre><code>visible according to the scope rules of the programming language from the point of execution in that frame</code></pre>
<p>
	This means that in the function
</p>
<pre><code>foo (a)
    int a;
{
bar (a);
{
    int b = test ();
    bar (b);
}
}</code></pre>
<p>
	you can examine and use the variable a whenever your program is executing within the function foo, but you can only use or examine the variable b while your program is executing inside the block where b is declared.
</p>
<p>
	There is an exception: you can refer to a variable or function whose scope is a single source file even if the current execution point is not in this file. But it is possible to have more than one such variable or function with the same name (in different source files). If that happens, referring to that name has unpredictable effects. If you wish, you can specify a static variable in a particular function or file by using the colon&ndash;colon (::) notation:
</p>
<pre><code>file::variable
function::variable</code></pre>
<p>
	Here file or function is the name of the context for the static variable. In the case of file names, you can use quotes to make sure GDB parses the file name as a single word&mdash;for example, to print a global value of x defined in f2.c:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p 'f2.c'::x</code></pre>
<p>
	The :: notation is normally used for referring to static variables, since you typically disambiguate uses of local variables in functions by selecting the appropriate frame and using the simple name of the variable. However, you may also use this notation to refer to local variables in frames enclosing the selected frame:
</p>
<pre><code>void
foo (int a)
{
if (a &lt; 10)
    bar (a);
else
    process (a);    /* Stop here */
}

int
bar (int a)
{
foo (a + 5);
}</code></pre>
<p>
	For example, if there is a breakpoint at the commented line, here is what you might see when the program stops after executing the call bar(0):
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p a
$1 = 10
(gdb) p bar::a
$2 = 5
(gdb) up 2
#2  0x080483d0 in foo (a=5) at foobar.c:12
(gdb) p a
$3 = 5
(gdb) p bar::a
$4 = 0</code></pre>
<p>
	These uses of &lsquo;::&rsquo; are very rarely in conflict with the very similar use of the same notation in C++. When they are in conflict, the C++ meaning takes precedence; however, this can be overridden by quoting the file or function name with single quotes.
</p>
<p>
	For example, suppose the program is stopped in a method of a class that has a field named includefile, and there is also an include file named includefile that defines a variable, some_global.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p includefile
$1 = 23
(gdb) p includefile::some_global
A syntax error in expression, near `'.
(gdb) p 'includefile'::some_global
$2 = 27

Warning: Occasionally, a local variable may appear to have the wrong value at certain points in a function—just after entry to a new scope, and just before exit.</code></pre>
<p>
	You may see this problem when you are stepping by machine instructions. This is because, on most machines, it takes more than one instruction to set up a stack frame (including local variable definitions); if you are stepping by machine instructions, variables may appear to have the wrong values until the stack frame is completely built. On exit, it usually also takes more than one machine instruction to destroy a stack frame; after you begin stepping through that group of instructions, local variable definitions may be gone.
</p>
<p>
	This may also happen when the compiler does significant optimizations. To be sure of always seeing accurate values, turn off all optimization when compiling.
</p>
<p>
	Another possible effect of compiler optimizations is to optimize unused variables out of existence, or assign variables to registers (as opposed to memory addresses). Depending on the support for such cases offered by the debug info format used by the compiler, GDB might not be able to display values for such local variables. If that happens, GDB will print a message like this:
</p>
<pre><code>No symbol "foo" in current context.</code></pre>
<p>
	To solve such problems, either recompile without optimizations, or use a different debug info format, if the compiler supports several such formats. See Compilation, for more information on choosing compiler options. See C and C++, for more information about debug info formats that are best suited to C++ programs.
</p>
<p>
	If you ask to print an object whose contents are unknown to GDB, e.g., because its data type is not completely specified by the debug information, GDB will say &lsquo;&lt;incomplete type&gt;&rsquo;. See incomplete type, for more about this.
</p>
<p>
	If you try to examine or use the value of a (global) variable for which GDB has no type information, e.g., because the program includes no debug information, GDB displays an error message. See unknown type, for more about unknown types. If you cast the variable to its declared type, GDB gets the variable&rsquo;s value using the cast&ndash;to type as the variable&rsquo;s type. For example, in a C program:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p var
'var' has unknown type; cast it to its declared type
(gdb) p (float) var
$1 = 3.14</code></pre>
<p>
	If you append @entry string to a function parameter name you get its value at the time the function got called. If the value is not available an error message is printed. Entry values are available only with some compilers. Entry values are normally also printed at the function parameter list according to set print entry&ndash;values.
</p>
<pre><code>Breakpoint 1, d (i=30) at gdb.base/entry-value.c:29
29	  i++;
(gdb) next
30	  e (i);
(gdb) print i
$1 = 31
(gdb) print i@entry
$2 = 30</code></pre>
<p>
	Strings are identified as arrays of char values without specified signedness. Arrays of either signed char or unsigned char get printed as arrays of 1 byte sized integers. &ndash;fsigned&ndash;char or &ndash;funsigned&ndash;char GCC options have no effect as GDB defines literal string type &quot;char&quot; as char without a sign. For program code
</p>
<pre><code>char var0[] = "A";
signed char var1[] = "A";</code></pre>
<p>
	You get during debugging
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print var0
$1 = "A"
(gdb) print var1
$2 = {65 'A', 0 '\0'}</code></pre>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_676a84a5" href="#TOC_HEAD_676a84a5">10.4 Artificial Arrays</a></H2>
<p>
	It is often useful to print out several successive objects of the same type in memory; a section of an array, or an array of dynamically determined size for which only a pointer exists in the program.
</p>
<p>
	You can do this by referring to a contiguous span of memory as an artificial array, using the binary operator &lsquo;@&rsquo;. The left operand of &lsquo;@&rsquo; should be the first element of the desired array and be an individual object. The right operand should be the desired length of the array. The result is an array value whose elements are all of the type of the left argument. The first element is actually the left argument; the second element comes from bytes of memory immediately following those that hold the first element, and so on. Here is an example. If a program says
</p>
<pre><code>int *array = (int *) malloc (len * sizeof (int));</code></pre>
<p>
	you can print the contents of array with
</p>
<pre><code>p *array@len</code></pre>
<p>
	The left operand of &lsquo;@&rsquo; must reside in memory. Array values made with &lsquo;@&rsquo; in this way behave just like other arrays in terms of subscripting, and are coerced to pointers when used in expressions. Artificial arrays most often appear in expressions via the value history (see Value History), after printing one out.
</p>
<p>
	Another way to create an artificial array is to use a cast. This re&ndash;interprets a value as if it were an array. The value need not be in memory:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p/x (short[2])0x12345678
$1 = {0x1234, 0x5678}</code></pre>
<p>
	As a convenience, if you leave the array length out (as in &lsquo;(type[])value&rsquo;) GDB calculates the size to fill the value (as &lsquo;sizeof(value)/sizeof(type)&rsquo;:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p/x (short[])0x12345678
$2 = {0x1234, 0x5678}</code></pre>
<p>
	Sometimes the artificial array mechanism is not quite enough; in moderately complex data structures, the elements of interest may not actually be adjacent&mdash;for example, if you are interested in the values of pointers in an array. One useful work&ndash;around in this situation is to use a convenience variable (see Convenience Variables) as a counter in an expression that prints the first interesting value, and then repeat that expression via RET. For instance, suppose you have an array dtab of pointers to structures, and you are interested in the values of a field fv in each structure. Here is an example of what you might type:
</p>
<pre><code>set $i = 0
p dtab[$i++]-&gt;fv
RET
RET
…</code></pre>

<p>
	By default, GDB prints a value according to its data type. Sometimes this is not what you want. For example, you might want to print a number in hex, or a pointer in decimal. Or you might want to view data in memory at a certain address as a character string or as an instruction. To do these things, specify an output format when you print a value.
</p>
<p>
	The simplest use of output formats is to say how to print a value already computed. This is done by starting the arguments of the print command with a slash and a format letter. The format letters supported are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>x</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the binary representation of the value in hexadecimal.
	</p>
	<li>d</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the binary representation of the value in decimal.
	</p>
	<li>u</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the binary representation of the value as an decimal, as if it were unsigned.
	</p>
	<li>o</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the binary representation of the value in octal.
	</p>
	<li>t</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the binary representation of the value in binary. The letter &lsquo;t&rsquo; stands for &ldquo;two&rdquo;. 11
	</p>
	<li>a</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print as an address, both absolute in hexadecimal and as an offset from the nearest preceding symbol. You can use this format used to discover where (in what function) an unknown address is located:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) p/a 0x54320
$3 = 0x54320 &lt;_initialize_vx+396&gt;	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The command info symbol 0x54320 yields similar results. See info symbol.
	</p>
	<li>c</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Cast the value to an integer (unlike other formats, this does not just reinterpret the underlying bits) and print it as a character constant. This prints both the numerical value and its character representation. The character representation is replaced with the octal escape &lsquo;\nnn&rsquo; for characters outside the 7&ndash;bit ASCII range.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without this format, GDB displays char, unsigned char, and signed char data as character constants. Single&ndash;byte members of vectors are displayed as integer data.
	</p>
	<li>f</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Regard the bits of the value as a floating point number and print using typical floating point syntax.
	</p>
	<li>s</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Regard as a string, if possible. With this format, pointers to single&ndash;byte data are displayed as null&ndash;terminated strings and arrays of single&ndash;byte data are displayed as fixed&ndash;length strings. Other values are displayed in their natural types.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without this format, GDB displays pointers to and arrays of char, unsigned char, and signed char as strings. Single&ndash;byte members of a vector are displayed as an integer array.
	</p>
	<li>z</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like &lsquo;x&rsquo; formatting, the value is treated as an integer and printed as hexadecimal, but leading zeros are printed to pad the value to the size of the integer type.
	</p>
	<li>r</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print using the &lsquo;raw&rsquo; formatting. By default, GDB will use a Python&ndash;based pretty&ndash;printer, if one is available (see Pretty Printing). This typically results in a higher&ndash;level display of the value&rsquo;s contents. The &lsquo;r&rsquo; format bypasses any Python pretty&ndash;printer which might exist.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	For example, to print the program counter in hex (see Registers), type
</p>
<pre><code>p/x $pc</code></pre>
<p>
	Note that no space is required before the slash; this is because command names in GDB cannot contain a slash.
</p>
<p>
	To reprint the last value in the value history with a different format, you can use the print command with just a format and no expression. For example, &lsquo;p/x&rsquo; reprints the last value in hex.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_616cd29c" href="#TOC_HEAD_616cd29c">10.6 Examining Memory</a></H2>
<p>
	You can use the command x (for &ldquo;examine&rdquo;) to examine memory in any of several formats, independently of your program&rsquo;s data types.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>x/nfu addr</li>
	<li>x addr</li>
	<li>x</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use the x command to examine memory.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	n, f, and u are all optional parameters that specify how much memory to display and how to format it; addr is an expression giving the address where you want to start displaying memory. If you use defaults for nfu, you need not type the slash &lsquo;/&rsquo;. Several commands set convenient defaults for addr.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>n, the repeat count</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The repeat count is a decimal integer; the default is 1. It specifies how much memory (counting by units u) to display. If a negative number is specified, memory is examined backward from addr.
	</p>
	<li>f, the display format</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The display format is one of the formats used by print (&lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;d&rsquo;, &lsquo;u&rsquo;, &lsquo;o&rsquo;, &lsquo;t&rsquo;, &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;c&rsquo;, &lsquo;f&rsquo;, &lsquo;s&rsquo;), &lsquo;i&rsquo; (for machine instructions) and &lsquo;m&rsquo; (for displaying memory tags). The default is &lsquo;x&rsquo; (hexadecimal) initially. The default changes each time you use either x or print.
	</p>
	<li>u, the unit size</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The unit size is any of
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>b</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Bytes.
		</p>
		<li>h</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Halfwords (two bytes).
		</p>
		<li>w</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Words (four bytes). This is the initial default.
		</p>
		<li>g</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Giant words (eight bytes).
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Each time you specify a unit size with x, that size becomes the default unit the next time you use x. For the &lsquo;i&rsquo; format, the unit size is ignored and is normally not written. For the &lsquo;s&rsquo; format, the unit size defaults to &lsquo;b&rsquo;, unless it is explicitly given. Use x /hs to display 16&ndash;bit char strings and x /ws to display 32&ndash;bit strings. The next use of x /s will again display 8&ndash;bit strings. Note that the results depend on the programming language of the current compilation unit. If the language is C, the &lsquo;s&rsquo; modifier will use the UTF&ndash;16 encoding while &lsquo;w&rsquo; will use UTF&ndash;32. The encoding is set by the programming language and cannot be altered.
	</p>
	<li>addr, starting display address</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		addr is the address where you want GDB to begin displaying memory. The expression need not have a pointer value (though it may); it is always interpreted as an integer address of a byte of memory. See Expressions, for more information on expressions. The default for addr is usually just after the last address examined&mdash;but several other commands also set the default address: info breakpoints (to the address of the last breakpoint listed), info line (to the starting address of a line), and print (if you use it to display a value from memory).
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	For example, &lsquo;x/3uh 0x54320&rsquo; is a request to display three halfwords (h) of memory, formatted as unsigned decimal integers (&lsquo;u&rsquo;), starting at address 0x54320. &lsquo;x/4xw $sp&rsquo; prints the four words (&lsquo;w&rsquo;) of memory above the stack pointer (here, &lsquo;$sp&rsquo;; see Registers) in hexadecimal (&lsquo;x&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>
	You can also specify a negative repeat count to examine memory backward from the given address. For example, &lsquo;x/&ndash;3uh 0x54320&rsquo; prints three halfwords (h) at 0x5431a, 0x5431c, and 0x5431e.
</p>
<p>
	Since the letters indicating unit sizes are all distinct from the letters specifying output formats, you do not have to remember whether unit size or format comes first; either order works. The output specifications &lsquo;4xw&rsquo; and &lsquo;4wx&rsquo; mean exactly the same thing. (However, the count n must come first; &lsquo;wx4&rsquo; does not work.)
</p>
<p>
	Even though the unit size u is ignored for the formats &lsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;i&rsquo;, you might still want to use a count n; for example, &lsquo;3i&rsquo; specifies that you want to see three machine instructions, including any operands. For convenience, especially when used with the display command, the &lsquo;i&rsquo; format also prints branch delay slot instructions, if any, beyond the count specified, which immediately follow the last instruction that is within the count. The command disassemble gives an alternative way of inspecting machine instructions; see Source and Machine Code.
</p>
<p>
	If a negative repeat count is specified for the formats &lsquo;s&rsquo; or &lsquo;i&rsquo;, the command displays null&ndash;terminated strings or instructions before the given address as many as the absolute value of the given number. For the &lsquo;i&rsquo; format, we use line number information in the debug info to accurately locate instruction boundaries while disassembling backward. If line info is not available, the command stops examining memory with an error message.
</p>
<p>
	All the defaults for the arguments to x are designed to make it easy to continue scanning memory with minimal specifications each time you use x. For example, after you have inspected three machine instructions with &lsquo;x/3i addr&rsquo;, you can inspect the next seven with just &lsquo;x/7&rsquo;. If you use RET to repeat the x command, the repeat count n is used again; the other arguments default as for successive uses of x.
</p>
<p>
	When examining machine instructions, the instruction at current program counter is shown with a =&gt; marker. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) x/5i $pc-6
0x804837f &lt;main+11&gt;: mov    %esp,%ebp
0x8048381 &lt;main+13&gt;: push   %ecx
0x8048382 &lt;main+14&gt;: sub    $0x4,%esp
=&gt; 0x8048385 &lt;main+17&gt;: movl   $0x8048460,(%esp)
0x804838c &lt;main+24&gt;: call   0x80482d4 &lt;puts@plt&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	If the architecture supports memory tagging, the tags can be displayed by using &lsquo;m&rsquo;. See Memory Tagging.
</p>
<p>
	The information will be displayed once per granule size (the amount of bytes a particular memory tag covers). For example, AArch64 has a granule size of 16 bytes, so it will display a tag every 16 bytes.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the way GDB prints information with the x command (not aligned to a particular boundary), the tag information will refer to the initial address displayed on a particular line. If a memory tag boundary is crossed in the middle of a line displayed by the x command, it will be displayed on the next line.
</p>
<p>
	The &lsquo;m&rsquo; format doesn&rsquo;t affect any other specified formats that were passed to the x command.
</p>
<p>
	The addresses and contents printed by the x command are not saved in the value history because there is often too much of them and they would get in the way. Instead, GDB makes these values available for subsequent use in expressions as values of the convenience variables $_ and $__. After an x command, the last address examined is available for use in expressions in the convenience variable $_. The contents of that address, as examined, are available in the convenience variable $__.
</p>
<p>
	If the x command has a repeat count, the address and contents saved are from the last memory unit printed; this is not the same as the last address printed if several units were printed on the last line of output.
</p>
<p>
	Most targets have an addressable memory unit size of 8 bits. This means that to each memory address are associated 8 bits of data. Some targets, however, have other addressable memory unit sizes. Within GDB and this document, the term addressable memory unit (or memory unit for short) is used when explicitly referring to a chunk of data of that size. The word byte is used to refer to a chunk of data of 8 bits, regardless of the addressable memory unit size of the target. For most systems, addressable memory unit is a synonym of byte.
</p>
<p>
	When you are debugging a program running on a remote target machine (see Remote Debugging), you may wish to verify the program&rsquo;s image in the remote machine&rsquo;s memory against the executable file you downloaded to the target. Or, on any target, you may want to check whether the program has corrupted its own read&ndash;only sections. The compare&ndash;sections command is provided for such situations.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>compare&ndash;sections [section&ndash;name|&ndash;r]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Compare the data of a loadable section section&ndash;name in the executable file of the program being debugged with the same section in the target machine&rsquo;s memory, and report any mismatches. With no arguments, compares all loadable sections. With an argument of &ndash;r, compares all loadable read&ndash;only sections.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: for remote targets, this command can be accelerated if the target supports computing the CRC checksum of a block of memory (see qCRC packet).
	</p>
	<li>Memory Tagging</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	Memory tagging is a memory protection technology that uses a pair of tags to validate memory accesses through pointers. The tags are integer values usually comprised of a few bits, depending on the architecture.
</p>
<p>
	There are two types of tags that are used in this setup: logical and allocation. A logical tag is stored in the pointers themselves, usually at the higher bits of the pointers. An allocation tag is the tag associated with particular ranges of memory in the physical address space, against which the logical tags from pointers are compared.
</p>
<p>
	The pointer tag (logical tag) must match the memory tag (allocation tag) for the memory access to be valid. If the logical tag does not match the allocation tag, that will raise a memory violation.
</p>
<p>
	Allocation tags cover multiple contiguous bytes of physical memory. This range of bytes is called a memory tag granule and is architecture&ndash;specific. For example, AArch64 has a tag granule of 16 bytes, meaning each allocation tag spans 16 bytes of memory.
</p>
<p>
	If the underlying architecture supports memory tagging, like AArch64 MTE or SPARC ADI do, GDB can make use of it to validate pointers against memory allocation tags.
</p>
<p>
	The print (see Data) and x (see Memory) commands will display tag information when appropriate, and a command prefix of memory&ndash;tag gives access to the various memory tagging commands.
</p>
<p>
	The memory&ndash;tag commands are the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>memory&ndash;tag print&ndash;logical&ndash;tag pointer_expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the logical tag stored in pointer_expression.
	</p>
	<li>memory&ndash;tag with&ndash;logical&ndash;tag pointer_expression tag_bytes</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the pointer given by pointer_expression, augmented with a logical tag of tag_bytes.
	</p>
	<li>memory&ndash;tag print&ndash;allocation&ndash;tag address_expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the allocation tag associated with the memory address given by address_expression.
	</p>
	<li>memory&ndash;tag setatag starting_address length tag_bytes</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the allocation tag(s) for memory range (starting_address, starting_address + length) to tag_bytes.
	</p>
	<li>memory&ndash;tag check pointer_expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Check if the logical tag in the pointer given by pointer_expression matches the allocation tag for the memory referenced by the pointer.
	</p>
	<p>
		This essentially emulates the hardware validation that is done when tagged memory is accessed through a pointer, but does not cause a memory fault as it would during hardware validation.
	</p>
	<p>
		It can be used to inspect potential memory tagging violations in the running process, before any faults get triggered.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_bf934f56" href="#TOC_HEAD_bf934f56">10.8 Automatic Display</a></H2>
<p>
	If you find that you want to print the value of an expression frequently (to see how it changes), you might want to add it to the automatic display list so that GDB prints its value each time your program stops. Each expression added to the list is given a number to identify it; to remove an expression from the list, you specify that number. The automatic display looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>2: foo = 38
3: bar[5] = (struct hack *) 0x3804</code></pre>
<p>
	This display shows item numbers, expressions and their current values. As with displays you request manually using x or print, you can specify the output format you prefer; in fact, display decides whether to use print or x depending your format specification&mdash;it uses x if you specify either the &lsquo;i&rsquo; or &lsquo;s&rsquo; format, or a unit size; otherwise it uses print.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>display expr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Add the expression expr to the list of expressions to display each time your program stops. See Expressions.
	</p>
	<p>
		display does not repeat if you press RET again after using it.
	</p>
	<li>display/fmt expr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For fmt specifying only a display format and not a size or count, add the expression expr to the auto&ndash;display list but arrange to display it each time in the specified format fmt. See Output Formats.
	</p>
	<li>display/fmt addr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For fmt &lsquo;i&rsquo; or &lsquo;s&rsquo;, or including a unit&ndash;size or a number of units, add the expression addr as a memory address to be examined each time your program stops. Examining means in effect doing &lsquo;x/fmt addr&rsquo;. See Examining Memory.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	For example, &lsquo;display/i $pc&rsquo; can be helpful, to see the machine instruction about to be executed each time execution stops (&lsquo;$pc&rsquo; is a common name for the program counter; see Registers).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>undisplay dnums&hellip;</li>
	<li>delete display dnums&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Remove items from the list of expressions to display. Specify the numbers of the displays that you want affected with the command argument dnums. It can be a single display number, one of the numbers shown in the first field of the &lsquo;info display&rsquo; display; or it could be a range of display numbers, as in 2&ndash;4.
	</p>
	<p>
		undisplay does not repeat if you press RET after using it. (Otherwise you would just get the error &lsquo;No display number &hellip;&rsquo;.)
	</p>
	<li>disable display dnums&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable the display of item numbers dnums. A disabled display item is not printed automatically, but is not forgotten. It may be enabled again later. Specify the numbers of the displays that you want affected with the command argument dnums. It can be a single display number, one of the numbers shown in the first field of the &lsquo;info display&rsquo; display; or it could be a range of display numbers, as in 2&ndash;4.
	</p>
	<li>enable display dnums&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable display of item numbers dnums. It becomes effective once again in auto display of its expression, until you specify otherwise. Specify the numbers of the displays that you want affected with the command argument dnums. It can be a single display number, one of the numbers shown in the first field of the &lsquo;info display&rsquo; display; or it could be a range of display numbers, as in 2&ndash;4.
	</p>
	<li>display</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current values of the expressions on the list, just as is done when your program stops.
	</p>
	<li>info display</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the list of expressions previously set up to display automatically, each one with its item number, but without showing the values. This includes disabled expressions, which are marked as such. It also includes expressions which would not be displayed right now because they refer to automatic variables not currently available.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If a display expression refers to local variables, then it does not make sense outside the lexical context for which it was set up. Such an expression is disabled when execution enters a context where one of its variables is not defined. For example, if you give the command display last_char while inside a function with an argument last_char, GDB displays this argument while your program continues to stop inside that function. When it stops elsewhere&mdash;where there is no variable last_char&mdash;the display is disabled automatically. The next time your program stops where last_char is meaningful, you can enable the display expression once again.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_ad607b2c" href="#TOC_HEAD_ad607b2c">10.9 Print Settings</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB provides the following ways to control how arrays, structures, and symbols are printed.
</p>
<p>
	These settings are useful for debugging programs in any language:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set print address</li>
	<li>set print address on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB prints memory addresses showing the location of stack traces, structure values, pointer values, breakpoints, and so forth, even when it also displays the contents of those addresses. The default is on. For example, this is what a stack frame display looks like with set print address on:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) f
#0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&lt;&lt;", rq=0x34c88 "&gt;&gt;")
    at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)	</code></pre>
	<li>set print address off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Do not print addresses when displaying their contents. For example, this is the same stack frame displayed with set print address off:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) set print addr off
(gdb) f
#0  set_quotes (lq="&lt;&lt;", rq="&gt;&gt;") at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		You can use &lsquo;set print address off&rsquo; to eliminate all machine dependent displays from the GDB interface. For example, with print address off, you should get the same text for backtraces on all machines&mdash;whether or not they involve pointer arguments.
	</p>
	<li>show print address</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether or not addresses are to be printed.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	When GDB prints a symbolic address, it normally prints the closest earlier symbol plus an offset. If that symbol does not uniquely identify the address (for example, it is a name whose scope is a single source file), you may need to clarify. One way to do this is with info line, for example &lsquo;info line *0x4537&rsquo;. Alternately, you can set GDB to print the source file and line number when it prints a symbolic address:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set print symbol&ndash;filename on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB to print the source file name and line number of a symbol in the symbolic form of an address.
	</p>
	<li>set print symbol&ndash;filename off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Do not print source file name and line number of a symbol. This is the default.
	</p>
	<li>show print symbol&ndash;filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether or not GDB will print the source file name and line number of a symbol in the symbolic form of an address.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Another situation where it is helpful to show symbol filenames and line numbers is when disassembling code; GDB shows you the line number and source file that corresponds to each instruction.
</p>
<p>
	Also, you may wish to see the symbolic form only if the address being printed is reasonably close to the closest earlier symbol:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set print max&ndash;symbolic&ndash;offset max&ndash;offset</li>
	<li>set print max&ndash;symbolic&ndash;offset unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB to only display the symbolic form of an address if the offset between the closest earlier symbol and the address is less than max&ndash;offset. The default is unlimited, which tells GDB to always print the symbolic form of an address if any symbol precedes it. Zero is equivalent to unlimited.
	</p>
	<li>show print max&ndash;symbolic&ndash;offset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Ask how large the maximum offset is that GDB prints in a symbolic address.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If you have a pointer and you are not sure where it points, try &lsquo;set print symbol&ndash;filename on&rsquo;. Then you can determine the name and source file location of the variable where it points, using &lsquo;p/a pointer&rsquo;. This interprets the address in symbolic form. For example, here GDB shows that a variable ptt points at another variable t, defined in hi2.c:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set print symbol-filename on
(gdb) p/a ptt
$4 = 0xe008 &lt;t in hi2.c&gt;

Warning: For pointers that point to a local variable, ‘p/a’ does not show the symbol name and filename of the referent, even with the appropriate set print options turned on.</code></pre>
<p>
	You can also enable &lsquo;/a&rsquo;&ndash;like formatting all the time using &lsquo;set print symbol on&rsquo;:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set print symbol on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB to print the symbol corresponding to an address, if one exists.
	</p>
	<li>set print symbol off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB not to print the symbol corresponding to an address. In this mode, GDB will still print the symbol corresponding to pointers to functions. This is the default.
	</p>
	<li>show print symbol</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether GDB will display the symbol corresponding to an address.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Other settings control how different kinds of objects are printed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set print array</li>
	<li>set print array on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Pretty print arrays. This format is more convenient to read, but uses more space. The default is off.
	</p>
	<li>set print array off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Return to compressed format for arrays.
	</p>
	<li>show print array</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether compressed or pretty format is selected for displaying arrays.
	</p>
	<li>set print array&ndash;indexes</li>
	<li>set print array&ndash;indexes on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the index of each element when displaying arrays. May be more convenient to locate a given element in the array or quickly find the index of a given element in that printed array. The default is off.
	</p>
	<li>set print array&ndash;indexes off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Stop printing element indexes when displaying arrays.
	</p>
	<li>show print array&ndash;indexes</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether the index of each element is printed when displaying arrays.
	</p>
	<li>set print nibbles</li>
	<li>set print nibbles on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print binary values in groups of four bits, known as nibbles, when using the print command of GDB with the option &lsquo;/t&rsquo;. For example, this is what it looks like with set print nibbles on:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) print val_flags
$1 = 1230
(gdb) print/t val_flags
$2 = 0100 1100 1110	</code></pre>
	<li>set print nibbles off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Don&rsquo;t printing binary values in groups. This is the default.
	</p>
	<li>show print nibbles</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether to print binary values in groups of four bits.
	</p>
	<li>set print characters number&ndash;of&ndash;characters</li>
	<li>set print characters elements</li>
	<li>set print characters unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a limit on how many characters of a string GDB will print. If GDB is printing a large string, it stops printing after it has printed the number of characters set by the set print characters command. This equally applies to multi&ndash;byte and wide character strings, that is for strings whose character type is wchar_t, char16_t, or char32_t it is the number of actual characters rather than underlying bytes the encoding uses that this setting controls. Setting number&ndash;of&ndash;characters to elements means that the limit on the number of characters to print follows one for array elements; see set print elements. Setting number&ndash;of&ndash;characters to unlimited means that the number of characters to print is unlimited. When GDB starts, this limit is set to elements.
	</p>
	<li>show print characters</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the number of characters of a large string that GDB will print.
	</p>
	<li>set print elements number&ndash;of&ndash;elements</li>
	<li>set print elements unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a limit on how many elements of an array GDB will print. If GDB is printing a large array, it stops printing after it has printed the number of elements set by the set print elements command. By default this limit also applies to the display of strings; see set print characters. When GDB starts, this limit is set to 200. Setting number&ndash;of&ndash;elements to unlimited or zero means that the number of elements to print is unlimited.
	</p>
	<p>
		When printing very large arrays, whose size is greater than max&ndash;value&ndash;size (see max&ndash;value&ndash;size), if the print elements is set such that the size of the elements being printed is less than or equal to max&ndash;value&ndash;size, then GDB will print the array (up to the print elements limit), and only max&ndash;value&ndash;size worth of data will be added into the value history (see Value History).
	</p>
	<li>show print elements</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the number of elements of a large array that GDB will print.
	</p>
	<li>set print frame&ndash;arguments value</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command allows to control how the values of arguments are printed when the debugger prints a frame (see Frames). The possible values are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>all</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The values of all arguments are printed.
		</p>
		<li>scalars</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print the value of an argument only if it is a scalar. The value of more complex arguments such as arrays, structures, unions, etc, is replaced by &hellip;. This is the default. Here is an example where only scalar arguments are shown:
		</p>
		<pre><code>#1  0x08048361 in call_me (i=3, s=…, ss=0xbf8d508c, u=…, e=green)
at frame-args.c:23		</code></pre>
		<li>none</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			None of the argument values are printed. Instead, the value of each argument is replaced by &hellip;. In this case, the example above now becomes:
		</p>
		<pre><code>#1  0x08048361 in call_me (i=…, s=…, ss=…, u=…, e=…)
at frame-args.c:23		</code></pre>
		<li>presence</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Only the presence of arguments is indicated by &hellip;. The &hellip; are not printed for function without any arguments. None of the argument names and values are printed. In this case, the example above now becomes:
		</p>
		<pre><code>#1  0x08048361 in call_me (…) at frame-args.c:23		</code></pre>
	</ul>
	<p>
		By default, only scalar arguments are printed. This command can be used to configure the debugger to print the value of all arguments, regardless of their type. However, it is often advantageous to not print the value of more complex parameters. For instance, it reduces the amount of information printed in each frame, making the backtrace more readable. Also, it improves performance when displaying Ada frames, because the computation of large arguments can sometimes be CPU&ndash;intensive, especially in large applications. Setting print frame&ndash;arguments to scalars (the default), none or presence avoids this computation, thus speeding up the display of each Ada frame.
	</p>
	<li>show print frame&ndash;arguments</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show how the value of arguments should be displayed when printing a frame.
	</p>
	<li>set print raw&ndash;frame&ndash;arguments on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print frame arguments in raw, non pretty&ndash;printed, form.
	</p>
	<li>set print raw&ndash;frame&ndash;arguments off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print frame arguments in pretty&ndash;printed form, if there is a pretty&ndash;printer for the value (see Pretty Printing), otherwise print the value in raw form. This is the default.
	</p>
	<li>show print raw&ndash;frame&ndash;arguments</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether to print frame arguments in raw form.
	</p>
	<li>set print entry&ndash;values value</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set printing of frame argument values at function entry. In some cases GDB can determine the value of function argument which was passed by the function caller, even if the value was modified inside the called function and therefore is different. With optimized code, the current value could be unavailable, but the entry value may still be known.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default value is default (see below for its description). Older GDB behaved as with the setting no. Compilers not supporting this feature will behave in the default setting the same way as with the no setting.
	</p>
	<p>
		This functionality is currently supported only by DWARF 2 debugging format and the compiler has to produce &lsquo;DW_TAG_call_site&rsquo; tags. With GCC, you need to specify &ndash;O &ndash;g during compilation, to get this information.
	</p>
	<p>
		The value parameter can be one of the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>no</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print only actual parameter values, never print values from function entry point.
		</p>
		<pre><code>#0  equal (val=5)
#0  different (val=6)
#0  lost (val=&lt;optimized out&gt;)
#0  born (val=10)
#0  invalid (val=&lt;optimized out&gt;)		</code></pre>
		<li>only</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print only parameter values from function entry point. The actual parameter values are never printed.
		</p>
		<pre><code>#0  equal (val@entry=5)
#0  different (val@entry=5)
#0  lost (val@entry=5)
#0  born (val@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;)
#0  invalid (val@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;)		</code></pre>
		<li>preferred</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print only parameter values from function entry point. If value from function entry point is not known while the actual value is known, print the actual value for such parameter.
		</p>
		<pre><code>#0  equal (val@entry=5)
#0  different (val@entry=5)
#0  lost (val@entry=5)
#0  born (val=10)
#0  invalid (val@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;)		</code></pre>
		<li>if&ndash;needed</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print actual parameter values. If actual parameter value is not known while value from function entry point is known, print the entry point value for such parameter.
		</p>
		<pre><code>#0  equal (val=5)
#0  different (val=6)
#0  lost (val@entry=5)
#0  born (val=10)
#0  invalid (val=&lt;optimized out&gt;)		</code></pre>
		<li>both</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Always print both the actual parameter value and its value from function entry point, even if values of one or both are not available due to compiler optimizations.
		</p>
		<pre><code>#0  equal (val=5, val@entry=5)
#0  different (val=6, val@entry=5)
#0  lost (val=&lt;optimized out&gt;, val@entry=5)
#0  born (val=10, val@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;)
#0  invalid (val=&lt;optimized out&gt;, val@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;)		</code></pre>
		<li>compact</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print the actual parameter value if it is known and also its value from function entry point if it is known. If neither is known, print for the actual value &lt;optimized out&gt;. If not in MI mode (see GDB/MI) and if both values are known and identical, print the shortened param=param@entry=VALUE notation.
		</p>
		<pre><code>#0  equal (val=val@entry=5)
#0  different (val=6, val@entry=5)
#0  lost (val@entry=5)
#0  born (val=10)
#0  invalid (val=&lt;optimized out&gt;)		</code></pre>
		<li>default</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Always print the actual parameter value. Print also its value from function entry point, but only if it is known. If not in MI mode (see GDB/MI) and if both values are known and identical, print the shortened param=param@entry=VALUE notation.
		</p>
		<pre><code>#0  equal (val=val@entry=5)
#0  different (val=6, val@entry=5)
#0  lost (val=&lt;optimized out&gt;, val@entry=5)
#0  born (val=10)
#0  invalid (val=&lt;optimized out&gt;)		</code></pre>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For analysis messages on possible failures of frame argument values at function entry resolution see set debug entry&ndash;values.
	</p>
	<li>show print entry&ndash;values</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the method being used for printing of frame argument values at function entry.
	</p>
	<li>set print frame&ndash;info value</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command allows to control the information printed when the debugger prints a frame. See Frames, Backtrace, for a general explanation about frames and frame information. Note that some other settings (such as set print frame&ndash;arguments and set print address) are also influencing if and how some frame information is displayed. In particular, the frame program counter is never printed if set print address is off.
	</p>
	<p>
		The possible values for set print frame&ndash;info are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>short&ndash;location</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print the frame level, the program counter (if not at the beginning of the location source line), the function, the function arguments.
		</p>
		<li>location</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Same as short&ndash;location but also print the source file and source line number.
		</p>
		<li>location&ndash;and&ndash;address</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Same as location but print the program counter even if located at the beginning of the location source line.
		</p>
		<li>source&ndash;line</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print the program counter (if not at the beginning of the location source line), the line number and the source line.
		</p>
		<li>source&ndash;and&ndash;location</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print what location and source&ndash;line are printing.
		</p>
		<li>auto</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The information printed for a frame is decided automatically by the GDB command that prints a frame. For example, frame prints the information printed by source&ndash;and&ndash;location while stepi will switch between source&ndash;line and source&ndash;and&ndash;location depending on the program counter. The default value is auto.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li>set print repeats number&ndash;of&ndash;repeats</li>
	<li>set print repeats unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the threshold for suppressing display of repeated array elements. When the number of consecutive identical elements of an array exceeds the threshold, GDB prints the string &quot;&lt;repeats n times&gt;&quot;, where n is the number of identical repetitions, instead of displaying the identical elements themselves. Setting the threshold to unlimited or zero will cause all elements to be individually printed. The default threshold is 10.
	</p>
	<li>show print repeats</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current threshold for printing repeated identical elements.
	</p>
	<li>set print max&ndash;depth depth</li>
	<li>set print max&ndash;depth unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the threshold after which nested structures are replaced with ellipsis, this can make visualising deeply nested structures easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, given this C code
	</p>
	<pre><code>typedef struct s1 { int a; } s1;
typedef struct s2 { s1 b; } s2;
typedef struct s3 { s2 c; } s3;
typedef struct s4 { s3 d; } s4;

s4 var = { { { { 3 } } } };	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The following table shows how different values of depth will effect how var is printed by GDB:
	</p>
	<pre><code>depth setting	Result of ‘p var’
unlimited	$1 = {d = {c = {b = {a = 3}}}}
0	$1 = {...}
1	$1 = {d = {...}}
2	$1 = {d = {c = {...}}}
3	$1 = {d = {c = {b = {...}}}}
4	$1 = {d = {c = {b = {a = 3}}}}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		To see the contents of structures that have been hidden the user can either increase the print max&ndash;depth, or they can print the elements of the structure that are visible, for example
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) set print max-depth 2
(gdb) p var
$1 = {d = {c = {...}}}
(gdb) p var.d
$2 = {c = {b = {...}}}
(gdb) p var.d.c
$3 = {b = {a = 3}}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The pattern used to replace nested structures varies based on language, for most languages {...} is used, but Fortran uses (...).
	</p>
	<li>show print max&ndash;depth</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current threshold after which nested structures are replaces with ellipsis.
	</p>
	<li>set print memory&ndash;tag&ndash;violations</li>
	<li>set print memory&ndash;tag&ndash;violations on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Cause GDB to display additional information about memory tag violations when printing pointers and addresses.
	</p>
	<li>set print memory&ndash;tag&ndash;violations off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Stop printing memory tag violation information.
	</p>
	<li>show print memory&ndash;tag&ndash;violations</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether memory tag violation information is displayed when printing pointers and addresses.
	</p>
	<li>set print null&ndash;stop</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Cause GDB to stop printing the characters of an array when the first NULL is encountered. This is useful when large arrays actually contain only short strings. The default is off.
	</p>
	<li>show print null&ndash;stop</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether GDB stops printing an array on the first NULL character.
	</p>
	<li>set print pretty on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Cause GDB to print structures in an indented format with one member per line, like this:
	</p>
	<pre><code>$1 = {
next = 0x0,
flags = {
    sweet = 1,
    sour = 1
},
meat = 0x54 "Pork"
}	</code></pre>
	<li>set print pretty off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Cause GDB to print structures in a compact format, like this:
	</p>
	<pre><code>$1 = {next = 0x0, flags = {sweet = 1, sour = 1}, \
meat = 0x54 "Pork"}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This is the default format.
	</p>
	<li>show print pretty</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show which format GDB is using to print structures.
	</p>
	<li>set print raw&ndash;values on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print values in raw form, without applying the pretty printers for the value.
	</p>
	<li>set print raw&ndash;values off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print values in pretty&ndash;printed form, if there is a pretty&ndash;printer for the value (see Pretty Printing), otherwise print the value in raw form.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default setting is &ldquo;off&rdquo;.
	</p>
	<li>show print raw&ndash;values</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether to print values in raw form.
	</p>
	<li>set print sevenbit&ndash;strings on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print using only seven&ndash;bit characters; if this option is set, GDB displays any eight&ndash;bit characters (in strings or character values) using the notation \nnn. This setting is best if you are working in English (ASCII) and you use the high&ndash;order bit of characters as a marker or &ldquo;meta&rdquo; bit.
	</p>
	<li>set print sevenbit&ndash;strings off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print full eight&ndash;bit characters. This allows the use of more international character sets, and is the default.
	</p>
	<li>show print sevenbit&ndash;strings</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether or not GDB is printing only seven&ndash;bit characters.
	</p>
	<li>set print union on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB to print unions which are contained in structures and other unions. This is the default setting.
	</p>
	<li>set print union off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB not to print unions which are contained in structures and other unions. GDB will print &quot;{...}&quot; instead.
	</p>
	<li>show print union</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Ask GDB whether or not it will print unions which are contained in structures and other unions.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, given the declarations
	</p>
	<pre><code>typedef enum {Tree, Bug} Species;
typedef enum {Big_tree, Acorn, Seedling} Tree_forms;
typedef enum {Caterpillar, Cocoon, Butterfly}
            Bug_forms;

struct thing {
Species it;
union {
    Tree_forms tree;
    Bug_forms bug;
} form;
};

struct thing foo = {Tree, {Acorn}};	</code></pre>
	<p>
		with set print union on in effect &lsquo;p foo&rsquo; would print
	</p>
	<pre><code>$1 = {it = Tree, form = {tree = Acorn, bug = Cocoon}}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		and with set print union off in effect it would print
	</p>
	<pre><code>$1 = {it = Tree, form = {...}}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		set print union affects programs written in C&ndash;like languages and in Pascal.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	These settings are of interest when debugging C++ programs:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set print demangle</li>
	<li>set print demangle on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print C++ names in their source form rather than in the encoded (&ldquo;mangled&rdquo;) form passed to the assembler and linker for type&ndash;safe linkage. The default is on.
	</p>
	<li>show print demangle</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether C++ names are printed in mangled or demangled form.
	</p>
	<li>set print asm&ndash;demangle</li>
	<li>set print asm&ndash;demangle on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print C++ names in their source form rather than their mangled form, even in assembler code printouts such as instruction disassemblies. The default is off.
	</p>
	<li>show print asm&ndash;demangle</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether C++ names in assembly listings are printed in mangled or demangled form.
	</p>
	<li>set demangle&ndash;style style</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Choose among several encoding schemes used by different compilers to represent C++ names. If you omit style, you will see a list of possible formats. The default value is auto, which lets GDB choose a decoding style by inspecting your program.
	</p>
	<li>show demangle&ndash;style</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the encoding style currently in use for decoding C++ symbols.
	</p>
	<li>set print object</li>
	<li>set print object on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When displaying a pointer to an object, identify the actual (derived) type of the object rather than the declared type, using the virtual function table. Note that the virtual function table is required&mdash;this feature can only work for objects that have run&ndash;time type identification; a single virtual method in the object&rsquo;s declared type is sufficient. Note that this setting is also taken into account when working with variable objects via MI (see GDB/MI).
	</p>
	<li>set print object off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display only the declared type of objects, without reference to the virtual function table. This is the default setting.
	</p>
	<li>show print object</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether actual, or declared, object types are displayed.
	</p>
	<li>set print static&ndash;members</li>
	<li>set print static&ndash;members on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print static members when displaying a C++ object. The default is on.
	</p>
	<li>set print static&ndash;members off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Do not print static members when displaying a C++ object.
	</p>
	<li>show print static&ndash;members</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether C++ static members are printed or not.
	</p>
	<li>set print pascal_static&ndash;members</li>
	<li>set print pascal_static&ndash;members on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print static members when displaying a Pascal object. The default is on.
	</p>
	<li>set print pascal_static&ndash;members off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Do not print static members when displaying a Pascal object.
	</p>
	<li>show print pascal_static&ndash;members</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether Pascal static members are printed or not.
	</p>
	<li>set print vtbl</li>
	<li>set print vtbl on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Pretty print C++ virtual function tables. The default is off. (The vtbl commands do not work on programs compiled with the HP ANSI C++ compiler (aCC).)
	</p>
	<li>set print vtbl off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Do not pretty print C++ virtual function tables.
	</p>
	<li>show print vtbl</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether C++ virtual function tables are pretty printed, or not.

<p>
	GDB provides a mechanism to allow pretty&ndash;printing of values using Python code. It greatly simplifies the display of complex objects. This mechanism works for both MI and the CLI.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_149e1668" href="#TOC_HEAD_149e1668">10.10.1 Pretty&ndash;Printer Introduction</a></H3>
<p>
	When GDB prints a value, it first sees if there is a pretty&ndash;printer registered for the value. If there is then GDB invokes the pretty&ndash;printer to print the value. Otherwise the value is printed normally.
</p>
<p>
	Pretty&ndash;printers are normally named. This makes them easy to manage. The &lsquo;info pretty&ndash;printer&rsquo; command will list all the installed pretty&ndash;printers with their names. If a pretty&ndash;printer can handle multiple data types, then its subprinters are the printers for the individual data types. Each such subprinter has its own name. The format of the name is printer&ndash;name;subprinter&ndash;name.
</p>
<p>
	Pretty&ndash;printers are installed by registering them with GDB. Typically they are automatically loaded and registered when the corresponding debug information is loaded, thus making them available without having to do anything special.
</p>
<p>
	There are three places where a pretty&ndash;printer can be registered.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pretty&ndash;printers registered globally are available when debugging all inferiors.</li>
	<li>Pretty&ndash;printers registered with a program space are available only when debugging that program. See Progspaces In Python, for more details on program spaces in Python.</li>
	<li>Pretty&ndash;printers registered with an objfile are loaded and unloaded with the corresponding objfile (e.g., shared library). See Objfiles In Python, for more details on objfiles in Python.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	See Selecting Pretty&ndash;Printers, for further information on how pretty&ndash;printers are selected,
</p>
<p>
	See Writing a Pretty&ndash;Printer, for implementing pretty printers for new types.

	<H3><a name="HEAD_8406a93b" href="#TOC_HEAD_8406a93b">10.10.2 Pretty&ndash;Printer Example</a></H3>
<p>
	Here is how a C++ std::string looks without a pretty&ndash;printer:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print s
$1 = {
static npos = 4294967295,
_M_dataplus = {
    &lt;std::allocator&lt;char&gt;&gt; = {
    &lt;__gnu_cxx::new_allocator&lt;char&gt;&gt; = {
        &lt;No data fields&gt;}, &lt;No data fields&gt;
    },
    members of std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;,
    std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;::_Alloc_hider:
    _M_p = 0x804a014 "abcd"
}
}</code></pre>
<p>
	With a pretty&ndash;printer for std::string only the contents are printed:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print s
$2 = "abcd"</code></pre>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_e997b9d8" href="#TOC_HEAD_e997b9d8">10.10.3 Pretty&ndash;Printer Commands</a></H3>
<ul>
	<li>info pretty&ndash;printer [object&ndash;regexp [name&ndash;regexp]]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the list of installed pretty&ndash;printers. This includes disabled pretty&ndash;printers, which are marked as such.
	</p>
	<p>
		object&ndash;regexp is a regular expression matching the objects whose pretty&ndash;printers to list. Objects can be global, the program space&rsquo;s file (see Progspaces In Python), and the object files within that program space (see Objfiles In Python). See Selecting Pretty&ndash;Printers, for details on how GDB looks up a printer from these three objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		name&ndash;regexp is a regular expression matching the name of the printers to list.
	</p>
	<li>disable pretty&ndash;printer [object&ndash;regexp [name&ndash;regexp]]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable pretty&ndash;printers matching object&ndash;regexp and name&ndash;regexp. A disabled pretty&ndash;printer is not forgotten, it may be enabled again later.
	</p>
	<li>enable pretty&ndash;printer [object&ndash;regexp [name&ndash;regexp]]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable pretty&ndash;printers matching object&ndash;regexp and name&ndash;regexp.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Example:
</p>
<p>
	Suppose we have three pretty&ndash;printers installed: one from library1.so named foo that prints objects of type foo, and another from library2.so named bar that prints two types of objects, bar1 and bar2.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info pretty-printer
library1.so:
foo
library2.so:
bar
    bar1
    bar2

(gdb) info pretty-printer library2
library2.so:
bar
    bar1
    bar2

(gdb) disable pretty-printer library1
1 printer disabled
2 of 3 printers enabled
(gdb) info pretty-printer
library1.so:
foo [disabled]
library2.so:
bar
    bar1
    bar2

(gdb) disable pretty-printer library2 bar;bar1
1 printer disabled
1 of 3 printers enabled
(gdb) info pretty-printer library2
library2.so:
bar
    bar1 [disabled]
    bar2

(gdb) disable pretty-printer library2 bar
1 printer disabled
0 of 3 printers enabled
(gdb) info pretty-printer
library1.so:
foo [disabled]
library2.so:
bar [disabled]
    bar1 [disabled]
    bar2</code></pre>
<p>
	Note that for bar the entire printer can be disabled, as can each individual subprinter.
</p>
<p>
	Printing values and frame arguments is done by default using the enabled pretty printers.
</p>
<p>
	The print option &ndash;raw&ndash;values and GDB setting set print raw&ndash;values (see set print raw&ndash;values) can be used to print values without applying the enabled pretty printers.
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, the backtrace option &ndash;raw&ndash;frame&ndash;arguments and GDB setting set print raw&ndash;frame&ndash;arguments (see set print raw&ndash;frame&ndash;arguments) can be used to ignore the enabled pretty printers when printing frame argument values.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_e91eda94" href="#TOC_HEAD_e91eda94">10.11 Value History</a></H2>
<p>
	Values printed by the print command are saved in the GDB value history. This allows you to refer to them in other expressions. Values are kept until the symbol table is re&ndash;read or discarded (for example with the file or symbol&ndash;file commands). When the symbol table changes, the value history is discarded, since the values may contain pointers back to the types defined in the symbol table.
</p>
<p>
	The values printed are given history numbers by which you can refer to them. These are successive integers starting with one. print shows you the history number assigned to a value by printing &lsquo;$num = &rsquo; before the value; here num is the history number.
</p>
<p>
	To refer to any previous value, use &lsquo;$&rsquo; followed by the value&rsquo;s history number. The way print labels its output is designed to remind you of this. Just $ refers to the most recent value in the history, and $$ refers to the value before that. $$n refers to the nth value from the end; $$2 is the value just prior to $$, $$1 is equivalent to $$, and $$0 is equivalent to $.
</p>
<p>
	For example, suppose you have just printed a pointer to a structure and want to see the contents of the structure. It suffices to type
</p>
<pre><code>p *$</code></pre>
<p>
	If you have a chain of structures where the component next points to the next one, you can print the contents of the next one with this:
</p>
<pre><code>p *$.next</code></pre>
<p>
	You can print successive links in the chain by repeating this command&mdash;which you can do by just typing RET.
</p>
<p>
	Note that the history records values, not expressions. If the value of x is 4 and you type these commands:
</p>
<pre><code>print x
set x=5</code></pre>
<p>
	then the value recorded in the value history by the print command remains 4 even though the value of x has changed.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>show values</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the last ten values in the value history, with their item numbers. This is like &lsquo;p $$9&rsquo; repeated ten times, except that show values does not change the history.
	</p>
	<li>show values n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print ten history values centered on history item number n.
	</p>
	<li>show values +</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print ten history values just after the values last printed. If no more values are available, show values + produces no display.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Pressing RET to repeat show values n has exactly the same effect as &lsquo;show values +&rsquo;.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_396ebe7e" href="#TOC_HEAD_396ebe7e">10.12 Convenience Variables</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB provides convenience variables that you can use within GDB to hold on to a value and refer to it later. These variables exist entirely within GDB; they are not part of your program, and setting a convenience variable has no direct effect on further execution of your program. That is why you can use them freely.
</p>
<p>
	Convenience variables are prefixed with &lsquo;$&rsquo;. Any name preceded by &lsquo;$&rsquo; can be used for a convenience variable, unless it is one of the predefined machine&ndash;specific register names (see Registers). (Value history references, in contrast, are numbers preceded by &lsquo;$&rsquo;. See Value History.)
</p>
<p>
	You can save a value in a convenience variable with an assignment expression, just as you would set a variable in your program. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>set $foo = *object_ptr</code></pre>
<p>
	would save in $foo the value contained in the object pointed to by object_ptr.
</p>
<p>
	Using a convenience variable for the first time creates it, but its value is void until you assign a new value. You can alter the value with another assignment at any time.
</p>
<p>
	Convenience variables have no fixed types. You can assign a convenience variable any type of value, including structures and arrays, even if that variable already has a value of a different type. The convenience variable, when used as an expression, has the type of its current value.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>show convenience</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print a list of convenience variables used so far, and their values, as well as a list of the convenience functions. Abbreviated show conv.
	</p>
	<li>init&ndash;if&ndash;undefined $variable = expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a convenience variable if it has not already been set. This is useful for user&ndash;defined commands that keep some state. It is similar, in concept, to using local static variables with initializers in C (except that convenience variables are global). It can also be used to allow users to override default values used in a command script.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the variable is already defined then the expression is not evaluated so any side&ndash;effects do not occur.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	One of the ways to use a convenience variable is as a counter to be incremented or a pointer to be advanced. For example, to print a field from successive elements of an array of structures:
</p>
<pre><code>set $i = 0
print bar[$i++]-&gt;contents</code></pre>
<p>
	Repeat that command by typing RET.
</p>
<p>
	Some convenience variables are created automatically by GDB and given values likely to be useful.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>$_</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The variable $_ is automatically set by the x command to the last address examined (see Examining Memory). Other commands which provide a default address for x to examine also set $_ to that address; these commands include info line and info breakpoint. The type of $_ is void * except when set by the x command, in which case it is a pointer to the type of $__.
	</p>
	<li>$__</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The variable $__ is automatically set by the x command to the value found in the last address examined. Its type is chosen to match the format in which the data was printed.
	</p>
	<li>$_exitcode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When the program being debugged terminates normally, GDB automatically sets this variable to the exit code of the program, and resets $_exitsignal to void.
	</p>
	<li>$_exitsignal</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When the program being debugged dies due to an uncaught signal, GDB automatically sets this variable to that signal&rsquo;s number, and resets $_exitcode to void.
	</p>
	<p>
		To distinguish between whether the program being debugged has exited (i.e., $_exitcode is not void) or signalled (i.e., $_exitsignal is not void), the convenience function $_isvoid can be used (see Convenience Functions). For example, considering the following source code:
	</p>
	<pre><code>#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
raise (SIGALRM);
return 0;
}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		A valid way of telling whether the program being debugged has exited or signalled would be:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) define has_exited_or_signalled
Type commands for definition of ``has_exited_or_signalled''.
End with a line saying just ``end''.
&gt;if $_isvoid ($_exitsignal)
&gt;echo The program has exited\n
&gt;else
&gt;echo The program has signalled\n
&gt;end
&gt;end
(gdb) run
Starting program:

Program terminated with signal SIGALRM, Alarm clock.
The program no longer exists.
(gdb) has_exited_or_signalled
The program has signalled	</code></pre>
	<p>
		As can be seen, GDB correctly informs that the program being debugged has signalled, since it calls raise and raises a SIGALRM signal. If the program being debugged had not called raise, then GDB would report a normal exit:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) has_exited_or_signalled
The program has exited	</code></pre>
	<li>$_exception</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The variable $_exception is set to the exception object being thrown at an exception&ndash;related catchpoint. See Set Catchpoints.
	</p>
	<li>$_ada_exception</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The variable $_ada_exception is set to the address of the exception being caught or thrown at an Ada exception&ndash;related catchpoint. See Set Catchpoints.
	</p>
	<li>$_probe_argc</li>
	<li>$_probe_arg0&hellip;$_probe_arg11</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Arguments to a static probe. See Static Probe Points.
	</p>
	<li>$_sdata</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The variable $_sdata contains extra collected static tracepoint data. See Tracepoint Action Lists. Note that $_sdata could be empty, if not inspecting a trace buffer, or if extra static tracepoint data has not been collected.
	</p>
	<li>$_siginfo</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The variable $_siginfo contains extra signal information (see extra signal information). Note that $_siginfo could be empty, if the application has not yet received any signals. For example, it will be empty before you execute the run command.
	</p>
	<li>$_tlb</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The variable $_tlb is automatically set when debugging applications running on MS&ndash;Windows in native mode or connected to gdbserver that supports the qGetTIBAddr request. See General Query Packets. This variable contains the address of the thread information block.
	</p>
	<li>$_inferior</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The number of the current inferior. See Debugging Multiple Inferiors Connections and Programs.
	</p>
	<li>$_thread</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The thread number of the current thread. See thread numbers.
	</p>
	<li>$_gthread</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The global number of the current thread. See global thread numbers.
	</p>
	<li>$_inferior_thread_count</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The number of live threads in the current inferior. See Threads.
	</p>
	<li>$_gdb_major</li>
	<li>$_gdb_minor</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The major and minor version numbers of the running GDB. Development snapshots and pretest versions have their minor version incremented by one; thus, GDB pretest 9.11.90 will produce the value 12 for $_gdb_minor. These variables allow you to write scripts that work with different versions of GDB without errors caused by features unavailable in some of those versions.
	</p>
	<li>$_shell_exitcode</li>
	<li>$_shell_exitsignal</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB commands such as shell and | are launching shell commands. When a launched command terminates, GDB automatically maintains the variables $_shell_exitcode and $_shell_exitsignal according to the exit status of the last launched command. These variables are set and used similarly to the variables $_exitcode and $_exitsignal.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_8029e1e3" href="#TOC_HEAD_8029e1e3">10.13 Convenience Functions</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB also supplies some convenience functions. These have a syntax similar to convenience variables. A convenience function can be used in an expression just like an ordinary function; however, a convenience function is implemented internally to GDB.
</p>
<p>
	These functions do not require GDB to be configured with Python support, which means that they are always available.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>$_isvoid (expr)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Return one if the expression expr is void. Otherwise it returns zero.
	</p>
	<p>
		A void expression is an expression where the type of the result is void. For example, you can examine a convenience variable (see Convenience Variables) to check whether it is void:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) print $_exitcode
$1 = void
(gdb) print $_isvoid ($_exitcode)
$2 = 1
(gdb) run
Starting program: ./a.out
[Inferior 1 (process 29572) exited normally]
(gdb) print $_exitcode
$3 = 0
(gdb) print $_isvoid ($_exitcode)
$4 = 0	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In the example above, we used $_isvoid to check whether $_exitcode is void before and after the execution of the program being debugged. Before the execution there is no exit code to be examined, therefore $_exitcode is void. After the execution the program being debugged returned zero, therefore $_exitcode is zero, which means that it is not void anymore.
	</p>
	<p>
		The void expression can also be a call of a function from the program being debugged. For example, given the following function:
	</p>
	<pre><code>void
foo (void)
{
}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The result of calling it inside GDB is void:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) print foo ()
$1 = void
(gdb) print $_isvoid (foo ())
$2 = 1
(gdb) set $v = foo ()
(gdb) print $v
$3 = void
(gdb) print $_isvoid ($v)
$4 = 1	</code></pre>
	<li>$_gdb_setting_str (setting)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Return the value of the GDB setting as a string. setting is any setting that can be used in a set or show command (see Controlling GDB).
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) show print frame-arguments
Printing of non-scalar frame arguments is "scalars".
(gdb) p $_gdb_setting_str("print frame-arguments")
$1 = "scalars"
(gdb) p $_gdb_setting_str("height")
$2 = "30"
(gdb)	</code></pre>
	<li>$_gdb_setting (setting)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Return the value of the GDB setting. The type of the returned value depends on the setting.
	</p>
	<p>
		The value type for boolean and auto boolean settings is int. The boolean values off and on are converted to the integer values 0 and 1. The value auto is converted to the value &ndash;1.
	</p>
	<p>
		The value type for integer settings is either unsigned int or int, depending on the setting.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some integer settings accept an unlimited value. Depending on the setting, the set command also accepts the value 0 or the value &ndash;1 as a synonym for unlimited. For example, set height unlimited is equivalent to set height 0.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some other settings that accept the unlimited value use the value 0 to literally mean zero. For example, set history size 0 indicates to not record any GDB commands in the command history. For such settings, &ndash;1 is the synonym for unlimited.
	</p>
	<p>
		See the documentation of the corresponding set command for the numerical value equivalent to unlimited.
	</p>
	<p>
		The $_gdb_setting function converts the unlimited value to a 0 or a &ndash;1 value according to what the set command uses.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) p $_gdb_setting_str("height")
$1 = "30"
(gdb) p $_gdb_setting("height")
$2 = 30
(gdb) set height unlimited
(gdb) p $_gdb_setting_str("height")
$3 = "unlimited"
(gdb) p $_gdb_setting("height")
$4 = 0

(gdb) p $_gdb_setting_str("history size")
$5 = "unlimited"
(gdb) p $_gdb_setting("history size")
$6 = -1
(gdb) p $_gdb_setting_str("disassemble-next-line")
$7 = "auto"
(gdb) p $_gdb_setting("disassemble-next-line")
$8 = -1
(gdb)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Other setting types (enum, filename, optional filename, string, string noescape) are returned as string values.
	</p>
	<li>$_gdb_maint_setting_str (setting)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like the $_gdb_setting_str function, but works with maintenance set variables.
	</p>
	<li>$_gdb_maint_setting (setting)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like the $_gdb_setting function, but works with maintenance set variables.
	</p>
	<li>$_shell (command&ndash;string)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Invoke a shell to execute command&ndash;string. command&ndash;string must be a string. The shell runs on the host machine, the machine GDB is running on. Returns the command&rsquo;s exit status. On Unix systems, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded, and non&ndash;zero exit status indicates failure. When a command terminates on a fatal signal whose number is N, GDB uses the value 128+N as the exit status, as is standard in Unix shells. Note that N is a host signal number, not a target signal number. If you&rsquo;re native debugging, they will be the same, but if cross debugging, the host vs target signal numbers may be completely unrelated. Please consult your host operating system&rsquo;s documentation for the mapping between host signal numbers and signal names. The shell to run is determined in the same way as for the shell command. See Shell Commands.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) print $_shell("true")
$1 = 0
(gdb) print $_shell("false")
$2 = 1
(gdb) p $_shell("echo hello")
hello
$3 = 0
(gdb) p $_shell("foobar")
bash: line 1: foobar: command not found
$4 = 127	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This may also be useful in breakpoint conditions. For example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) break function if $_shell("some command") == 0	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In this scenario, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that the shell command you run in the breakpoint condition takes the least amount of time possible. For example, avoid running a command that may block indefinitely, or that sleeps for a while before exiting. Prefer a command or script which analyzes some state and exits immediately. This is important because the debugged program stops for the breakpoint every time, and then GDB evaluates the breakpoint condition. If the condition is false, the program is re&ndash;resumed transparently, without informing you of the stop. A quick shell command thus avoids significantly slowing down the debugged program unnecessarily.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: unlike the shell command, the $_shell convenience function does not affect the $_shell_exitcode and $_shell_exitsignal convenience variables.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The following functions require GDB to be configured with Python support.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>$_memeq(buf1, buf2, length)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Returns one if the length bytes at the addresses given by buf1 and buf2 are equal. Otherwise it returns zero.
	</p>
	<li>$_regex(str, regex)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Returns one if the string str matches the regular expression regex. Otherwise it returns zero. The syntax of the regular expression is that specified by Python&rsquo;s regular expression support.
	</p>
	<li>$_streq(str1, str2)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Returns one if the strings str1 and str2 are equal. Otherwise it returns zero.
	</p>
	<li>$_strlen(str)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Returns the length of string str.
	</p>
	<li>$_caller_is(name[, number_of_frames])</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Returns one if the calling function&rsquo;s name is equal to name. Otherwise it returns zero.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the optional argument number_of_frames is provided, it is the number of frames up in the stack to look. The default is 1.

	<H2><a name="HEAD_24df2fc2" href="#TOC_HEAD_24df2fc2">10.14 Registers</a></H2>
<p>
	You can refer to machine register contents, in expressions, as variables with names starting with &lsquo;$&rsquo;. The names of registers are different for each machine; use info registers to see the names used on your machine.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info registers</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the names and values of all registers except floating&ndash;point and vector registers (in the selected stack frame).
	</p>
	<li>info all&ndash;registers</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the names and values of all registers, including floating&ndash;point and vector registers (in the selected stack frame).
	</p>
	<li>info registers reggroup &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the name and value of the registers in each of the specified reggroups. The reggroup can be any of those returned by maint print reggroups (see Maintenance Commands).
	</p>
	<li>info registers regname &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the relativized value of each specified register regname. As discussed in detail below, register values are normally relative to the selected stack frame. The regname may be any register name valid on the machine you are using, with or without the initial &lsquo;$&rsquo;.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	GDB has four &ldquo;standard&rdquo; register names that are available (in expressions) on most machines&mdash;whenever they do not conflict with an architecture&rsquo;s canonical mnemonics for registers. The register names $pc and $sp are used for the program counter register and the stack pointer. $fp is used for a register that contains a pointer to the current stack frame, and $ps is used for a register that contains the processor status. For example, you could print the program counter in hex with
</p>
<pre><code>p/x $pc</code></pre>
<p>
	or print the instruction to be executed next with
</p>
<pre><code>x/i $pc</code></pre>
<p>
	or add four to the stack pointer12 with
</p>
<pre><code>set $sp += 4</code></pre>
<p>
	Whenever possible, these four standard register names are available on your machine even though the machine has different canonical mnemonics, so long as there is no conflict. The info registers command shows the canonical names. For example, on the SPARC, info registers displays the processor status register as $psr but you can also refer to it as $ps; and on x86&ndash;based machines $ps is an alias for the EFLAGS register.
</p>
<p>
	GDB always considers the contents of an ordinary register as an integer when the register is examined in this way. Some machines have special registers which can hold nothing but floating point; these registers are considered to have floating point values. There is no way to refer to the contents of an ordinary register as floating point value (although you can print it as a floating point value with &lsquo;print/f $regname&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>
	Some registers have distinct &ldquo;raw&rdquo; and &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; data formats. This means that the data format in which the register contents are saved by the operating system is not the same one that your program normally sees. For example, the registers of the 68881 floating point coprocessor are always saved in &ldquo;extended&rdquo; (raw) format, but all C programs expect to work with &ldquo;double&rdquo; (virtual) format. In such cases, GDB normally works with the virtual format only (the format that makes sense for your program), but the info registers command prints the data in both formats.
</p>
<p>
	Some machines have special registers whose contents can be interpreted in several different ways. For example, modern x86&ndash;based machines have SSE and MMX registers that can hold several values packed together in several different formats. GDB refers to such registers in struct notation:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print $xmm1
$1 = {
v4_float = {0, 3.43859137e-038, 1.54142831e-044, 1.821688e-044},
v2_double = {9.92129282474342e-303, 2.7585945287983262e-313},
v16_int8 = "\000\000\000\000\3706;\001\v\000\000\000\r\000\000",
v8_int16 = {0, 0, 14072, 315, 11, 0, 13, 0},
v4_int32 = {0, 20657912, 11, 13},
v2_int64 = {88725056443645952, 55834574859},
uint128 = 0x0000000d0000000b013b36f800000000
}</code></pre>
<p>
	To set values of such registers, you need to tell GDB which view of the register you wish to change, as if you were assigning value to a struct member:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set $xmm1.uint128 = 0x000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFF</code></pre>
<p>
	Normally, register values are relative to the selected stack frame (see Selecting a Frame). This means that you get the value that the register would contain if all stack frames farther in were exited and their saved registers restored. In order to see the true contents of hardware registers, you must select the innermost frame (with &lsquo;frame 0&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>
	Usually ABIs reserve some registers as not needed to be saved by the callee (a.k.a.: &ldquo;caller&ndash;saved&rdquo;, &ldquo;call&ndash;clobbered&rdquo; or &ldquo;volatile&rdquo; registers). It may therefore not be possible for GDB to know the value a register had before the call (in other words, in the outer frame), if the register value has since been changed by the callee. GDB tries to deduce where the inner frame saved (&ldquo;callee&ndash;saved&rdquo;) registers, from the debug info, unwind info, or the machine code generated by your compiler. If some register is not saved, and GDB knows the register is &ldquo;caller&ndash;saved&rdquo; (via its own knowledge of the ABI, or because the debug/unwind info explicitly says the register&rsquo;s value is undefined), GDB displays &lsquo;&lt;not saved&gt;&rsquo; as the register&rsquo;s value. With targets that GDB has no knowledge of the register saving convention, if a register was not saved by the callee, then its value and location in the outer frame are assumed to be the same of the inner frame. This is usually harmless, because if the register is call&ndash;clobbered, the caller either does not care what is in the register after the call, or has code to restore the value that it does care about. Note, however, that if you change such a register in the outer frame, you may also be affecting the inner frame. Also, the more &ldquo;outer&rdquo; the frame is you&rsquo;re looking at, the more likely a call&ndash;clobbered register&rsquo;s value is to be wrong, in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t actually represent the value the register had just before the call.

</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_ad31264b" href="#TOC_HEAD_ad31264b">10.17 Operating System Auxiliary Information</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB provides interfaces to useful OS facilities that can help you debug your program.
</p>
<p>
	Some operating systems supply an auxiliary vector to programs at startup. This is akin to the arguments and environment that you specify for a program, but contains a system&ndash;dependent variety of binary values that tell system libraries important details about the hardware, operating system, and process. Each value&rsquo;s purpose is identified by an integer tag; the meanings are well&ndash;known but system&ndash;specific. Depending on the configuration and operating system facilities, GDB may be able to show you this information. For remote targets, this functionality may further depend on the remote stub&rsquo;s support of the &lsquo;qXfer:auxv:read&rsquo; packet, see qXfer auxiliary vector read.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info auxv</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the auxiliary vector of the inferior, which can be either a live process or a core dump file. GDB prints each tag value numerically, and also shows names and text descriptions for recognized tags. Some values in the vector are numbers, some bit masks, and some pointers to strings or other data. GDB displays each value in the most appropriate form for a recognized tag, and in hexadecimal for an unrecognized tag.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	On some targets, GDB can access operating system&ndash;specific information and show it to you. The types of information available will differ depending on the type of operating system running on the target. The mechanism used to fetch the data is described in Operating System Information. For remote targets, this functionality depends on the remote stub&rsquo;s support of the &lsquo;qXfer:osdata:read&rsquo; packet, see qXfer osdata read.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info os infotype</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display OS information of the requested type.
	</p>
	<p>
		On GNU/Linux, the following values of infotype are valid:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>cpus</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of all CPUs/cores. For each CPU/core, GDB prints the available fields from /proc/cpuinfo. For each supported architecture different fields are available. Two common entries are processor which gives CPU number and bogomips; a system constant that is calculated during kernel initialization.
		</p>
		<li>files</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of open file descriptors on the target. For each file descriptor, GDB prints the identifier of the process owning the descriptor, the command of the owning process, the value of the descriptor, and the target of the descriptor.
		</p>
		<li>modules</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of all loaded kernel modules on the target. For each module, GDB prints the module name, the size of the module in bytes, the number of times the module is used, the dependencies of the module, the status of the module, and the address of the loaded module in memory.
		</p>
		<li>msg</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of all System V message queues on the target. For each message queue, GDB prints the message queue key, the message queue identifier, the access permissions, the current number of bytes on the queue, the current number of messages on the queue, the processes that last sent and received a message on the queue, the user and group of the owner and creator of the message queue, the times at which a message was last sent and received on the queue, and the time at which the message queue was last changed.
		</p>
		<li>processes</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of processes on the target. For each process, GDB prints the process identifier, the name of the user, the command corresponding to the process, and the list of processor cores that the process is currently running on. (To understand what these properties mean, for this and the following info types, please consult the general GNU/Linux documentation.)
		</p>
		<li>procgroups</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of process groups on the target. For each process, GDB prints the identifier of the process group that it belongs to, the command corresponding to the process group leader, the process identifier, and the command line of the process. The list is sorted first by the process group identifier, then by the process identifier, so that processes belonging to the same process group are grouped together and the process group leader is listed first.
		</p>
		<li>semaphores</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of all System V semaphore sets on the target. For each semaphore set, GDB prints the semaphore set key, the semaphore set identifier, the access permissions, the number of semaphores in the set, the user and group of the owner and creator of the semaphore set, and the times at which the semaphore set was operated upon and changed.
		</p>
		<li>shm</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of all System V shared&ndash;memory regions on the target. For each shared&ndash;memory region, GDB prints the region key, the shared&ndash;memory identifier, the access permissions, the size of the region, the process that created the region, the process that last attached to or detached from the region, the current number of live attaches to the region, and the times at which the region was last attached to, detach from, and changed.
		</p>
		<li>sockets</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of Internet&ndash;domain sockets on the target. For each socket, GDB prints the address and port of the local and remote endpoints, the current state of the connection, the creator of the socket, the IP address family of the socket, and the type of the connection.
		</p>
		<li>threads</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display the list of threads running on the target. For each thread, GDB prints the identifier of the process that the thread belongs to, the command of the process, the thread identifier, and the processor core that it is currently running on. The main thread of a process is not listed.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li>info os</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If infotype is omitted, then list the possible values for infotype and the kind of OS information available for each infotype. If the target does not return a list of possible types, this command will report an error.

	Memory region attributes allow you to describe special handling required by regions of your target&rsquo;s memory. GDB uses attributes to determine whether to allow certain types of memory accesses; whether to use specific width accesses; and whether to cache target memory. By default the description of memory regions is fetched from the target (if the current target supports this), but the user can override the fetched regions.
</p>
<p>
	Defined memory regions can be individually enabled and disabled. When a memory region is disabled, GDB uses the default attributes when accessing memory in that region. Similarly, if no memory regions have been defined, GDB uses the default attributes when accessing all memory.
</p>
<p>
	When a memory region is defined, it is given a number to identify it; to enable, disable, or remove a memory region, you specify that number.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>mem lower upper attributes&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Define a memory region bounded by lower and upper with attributes attributes&hellip;, and add it to the list of regions monitored by GDB. Note that upper == 0 is a special case: it is treated as the target&rsquo;s maximum memory address. (0xffff on 16 bit targets, 0xffffffff on 32 bit targets, etc.)
	</p>
	<li>mem auto</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Discard any user changes to the memory regions and use target&ndash;supplied regions, if available, or no regions if the target does not support.
	</p>
	<li>delete mem nums&hellip;</li>

		Remove memory regions nums&hellip; from the list of regions monitored by GDB.
	</p>
	<li>disable mem nums&hellip;</li>

<p>
	The access mode attributes set whether GDB may make read or write accesses to a memory region.

		If on is specified, make GDB treat memory not explicitly described by the memory ranges as non&ndash;existent and refuse accesses to such memory. The checks are only performed if there&rsquo;s at least one memory range defined. If off is specified, make GDB treat the memory not explicitly described by the memory ranges as RAM. The default value is on.

<p>
	You can use the commands dump, append, and restore to copy data between target memory and a file. The dump and append commands write data to a file, and the restore command reads data from a file back into the inferior&rsquo;s memory. Files may be in binary, Motorola S&ndash;record, Intel hex, Tektronix Hex, or Verilog Hex format; however, GDB can only append to binary files, and cannot read from Verilog Hex files.

		Append the contents of memory from start_addr to end_addr, or the value of expr, to the file filename, in raw binary form. (GDB can only append data to files in raw binary form.)
	</p>
	<li>restore filename [binary] bias start end</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Restore the contents of file filename into memory. The restore command can automatically recognize any known BFD file format, except for raw binary. To restore a raw binary file you must specify the optional keyword binary after the filename.
	</p>
	<p>
		If bias is non&ndash;zero, its value will be added to the addresses contained in the file. Binary files always start at address zero, so they will be restored at address bias. Other bfd files have a built&ndash;in location; they will be restored at offset bias from that location.
	</p>
	<p>
		If start and/or end are non&ndash;zero, then only data between file offset start and file offset end will be restored. These offsets are relative to the addresses in the file, before the bias argument is applied.

	<H2><a name="HEAD_c6a3f689" href="#TOC_HEAD_c6a3f689">10.20 How to Produce a Core File from Your Program</a></H2>
<p>
	A core file or core dump is a file that records the memory image of a running process and its process status (register values etc.). Its primary use is post&ndash;mortem debugging of a program that crashed while it ran outside a debugger. A program that crashes automatically produces a core file, unless this feature is disabled by the user. See Files, for information on invoking GDB in the post&ndash;mortem debugging mode.
</p>
<p>
	Occasionally, you may wish to produce a core file of the program you are debugging in order to preserve a snapshot of its state. GDB has a special command for that.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>generate&ndash;core&ndash;file [file]</li>
	<li>gcore [file]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Produce a core dump of the inferior process. The optional argument file specifies the file name where to put the core dump. If not specified, the file name defaults to core.pid, where pid is the inferior process ID.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that this command is implemented only for some systems (as of this writing, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and S390).
	</p>
	<p>
		On GNU/Linux, this command can take into account the value of the file /proc/pid/coredump_filter when generating the core dump (see set use&ndash;coredump&ndash;filter), and by default honors the VM_DONTDUMP flag for mappings where it is present in the file /proc/pid/smaps (see set dump&ndash;excluded&ndash;mappings).
	</p>
	<li>set use&ndash;coredump&ndash;filter on</li>
	<li>set use&ndash;coredump&ndash;filter off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable or disable the use of the file /proc/pid/coredump_filter when generating core dump files. This file is used by the Linux kernel to decide what types of memory mappings will be dumped or ignored when generating a core dump file. pid is the process ID of a currently running process.
	</p>
	<p>
		To make use of this feature, you have to write in the /proc/pid/coredump_filter file a value, in hexadecimal, which is a bit mask representing the memory mapping types. If a bit is set in the bit mask, then the memory mappings of the corresponding types will be dumped; otherwise, they will be ignored. This configuration is inherited by child processes. For more information about the bits that can be set in the /proc/pid/coredump_filter file, please refer to the manpage of core(5).
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, this option is on. If this option is turned off, GDB does not read the coredump_filter file and instead uses the same default value as the Linux kernel in order to decide which pages will be dumped in the core dump file. This value is currently 0x33, which means that bits 0 (anonymous private mappings), 1 (anonymous shared mappings), 4 (ELF headers) and 5 (private huge pages) are active. This will cause these memory mappings to be dumped automatically.
	</p>
	<li>set dump&ndash;excluded&ndash;mappings on</li>
	<li>set dump&ndash;excluded&ndash;mappings off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If on is specified, GDB will dump memory mappings marked with the VM_DONTDUMP flag. This flag is represented in the file /proc/pid/smaps with the acronym dd.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default value is off.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_37b1f11a" href="#TOC_HEAD_37b1f11a">10.21 Character Sets</a></H2>
<p>
	If the program you are debugging uses a different character set to represent characters and strings than the one GDB uses itself, GDB can automatically translate between the character sets for you. The character set GDB uses we call the host character set; the one the inferior program uses we call the target character set.
</p>
<p>
	For example, if you are running GDB on a GNU/Linux system, which uses the ISO Latin 1 character set, but you are using GDB&rsquo;s remote protocol (see Remote Debugging) to debug a program running on an IBM mainframe, which uses the EBCDIC character set, then the host character set is Latin&ndash;1, and the target character set is EBCDIC. If you give GDB the command set target&ndash;charset EBCDIC&ndash;US, then GDB translates between EBCDIC and Latin 1 as you print character or string values, or use character and string literals in expressions.
</p>
<p>
	GDB has no way to automatically recognize which character set the inferior program uses; you must tell it, using the set target&ndash;charset command, described below.
</p>
<p>
	Here are the commands for controlling GDB&rsquo;s character set support:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set target&ndash;charset charset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the current target character set to charset. To display the list of supported target character sets, type set target&ndash;charset TABTAB.
	</p>
	<li>set host&ndash;charset charset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the current host character set to charset.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, GDB uses a host character set appropriate to the system it is running on; you can override that default using the set host&ndash;charset command. On some systems, GDB cannot automatically determine the appropriate host character set. In this case, GDB uses &lsquo;UTF&ndash;8&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB can only use certain character sets as its host character set. If you type set host&ndash;charset TABTAB, GDB will list the host character sets it supports.
	</p>
	<li>set charset charset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the current host and target character sets to charset. As above, if you type set charset TABTAB, GDB will list the names of the character sets that can be used for both host and target.
	</p>
	<li>show charset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the names of the current host and target character sets.
	</p>
	<li>show host&ndash;charset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the name of the current host character set.
	</p>
	<li>show target&ndash;charset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the name of the current target character set.
		set target&ndash;wide&ndash;charset charset
	</p>
	<p>
		Set the current target&rsquo;s wide character set to charset. This is the character set used by the target&rsquo;s wchar_t type. To display the list of supported wide character sets, type set target&ndash;wide&ndash;charset TABTAB.
	</p>
	<li>show target&ndash;wide&ndash;charset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the name of the current target&rsquo;s wide character set.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Here is an example of GDB&rsquo;s character set support in action. Assume that the following source code has been placed in the file charset&ndash;test.c:
</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

char ascii_hello[]
= {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 119,
    111, 114, 108, 100, 33, 10, 0};
char ibm1047_hello[]
= {200, 133, 147, 147, 150, 107, 64, 166,
    150, 153, 147, 132, 90, 37, 0};

main ()
{
printf ("Hello, world!\n");
}</code></pre>
<p>
	In this program, ascii_hello and ibm1047_hello are arrays containing the string &lsquo;Hello, world!&rsquo; followed by a newline, encoded in the ASCII and IBM1047 character sets.
</p>
<p>
	We compile the program, and invoke the debugger on it:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -g charset-test.c -o charset-test
$ gdb -nw charset-test
GNU gdb 2001-12-19-cvs
Copyright 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
…
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	We can use the show charset command to see what character sets GDB is currently using to interpret and display characters and strings:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) show charset
The current host and target character set is `ISO-8859-1'.
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	For the sake of printing this manual, let&rsquo;s use ASCII as our initial character set:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set charset ASCII
(gdb) show charset
The current host and target character set is `ASCII'.
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	Let&rsquo;s assume that ASCII is indeed the correct character set for our host system &mdash; in other words, let&rsquo;s assume that if GDB prints characters using the ASCII character set, our terminal will display them properly. Since our current target character set is also ASCII, the contents of ascii_hello print legibly:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print ascii_hello
$1 = 0x401698 "Hello, world!\n"
(gdb) print ascii_hello[0]
$2 = 72 'H'
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB uses the target character set for character and string literals you use in expressions:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print '+'
$3 = 43 '+'
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	The ASCII character set uses the number 43 to encode the &lsquo;+&rsquo; character.
</p>
<p>
	GDB relies on the user to tell it which character set the target program uses. If we print ibm1047_hello while our target character set is still ASCII, we get jibberish:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print ibm1047_hello
$4 = 0x4016a8 "\310\205\223\223\226k@\246\226\231\223\204Z%"
(gdb) print ibm1047_hello[0]
$5 = 200 '\310'
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	If we invoke the set target&ndash;charset followed by TABTAB, GDB tells us the character sets it supports:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set target-charset
ASCII       EBCDIC-US   IBM1047     ISO-8859-1
(gdb) set target-charset</code></pre>
<p>
	We can select IBM1047 as our target character set, and examine the program&rsquo;s strings again. Now the ASCII string is wrong, but GDB translates the contents of ibm1047_hello from the target character set, IBM1047, to the host character set, ASCII, and they display correctly:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set target-charset IBM1047
(gdb) show charset
The current host character set is `ASCII'.
The current target character set is `IBM1047'.
(gdb) print ascii_hello
$6 = 0x401698 "\110\145%%?\054\040\167?\162%\144\041\012"
(gdb) print ascii_hello[0]
$7 = 72 '\110'
(gdb) print ibm1047_hello
$8 = 0x4016a8 "Hello, world!\n"
(gdb) print ibm1047_hello[0]
$9 = 200 'H'
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	As above, GDB uses the target character set for character and string literals you use in expressions:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print '+'
$10 = 78 '+'
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	The IBM1047 character set uses the number 78 to encode the &lsquo;+&rsquo; character.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_ef333a7d" href="#TOC_HEAD_ef333a7d">10.22 Caching Data of Targets</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB caches data exchanged between the debugger and a target. Each cache is associated with the address space of the inferior. See Inferiors Connections and Programs, about inferior and address space. Such caching generally improves performance in remote debugging (see Remote Debugging), because it reduces the overhead of the remote protocol by bundling memory reads and writes into large chunks. Unfortunately, simply caching everything would lead to incorrect results, since GDB does not necessarily know anything about volatile values, memory&ndash;mapped I/O addresses, etc. Furthermore, in non&ndash;stop mode (see Non&ndash;Stop Mode) memory can be changed while a gdb command is executing. Therefore, by default, GDB only caches data known to be on the stack13 or in the code segment. Other regions of memory can be explicitly marked as cacheable; see Memory Region Attributes.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set remotecache on</li>

		Print the information about the performance of data cache of the current inferior&rsquo;s address space. The information displayed includes the dcache width and depth, and for each cache line, its number, address, and how many times it was referenced. This command is useful for debugging the data cache operation.

</ul>
<p>
	s and n are optional parameters. They may be specified in either order, apart or together.
</p>
<p>
	s, search query size
</p>
<pre><code>The size of each search query value.

- b

bytes

- h

halfwords (two bytes)

- w

words (four bytes)

- g

giant words (eight bytes)

All values are interpreted in the current language. This means, for example, that if the current source language is C/C++ then searching for the string “hello” includes the trailing ’\0’. The null terminator can be removed from searching by using casts, e.g.: ‘{char[5]}"hello"’.

If the value size is not specified, it is taken from the value’s type in the current language. This is useful when one wants to specify the search pattern as a mixture of types. Note that this means, for example, that in the case of C-like languages a search for an untyped 0x42 will search for ‘(int) 0x42’ which is typically four bytes.</code></pre>
<p>
	n, maximum number of finds
</p>
<pre><code>The maximum number of matches to print. The default is to print all finds.</code></pre>
<p>
	You can use strings as search values. Quote them with double&ndash;quotes (&quot;). The string value is copied into the search pattern byte by byte, regardless of the endianness of the target and the size specification.
</p>
<p>
	The address of each match found is printed as well as a count of the number of matches found.
</p>
<p>
	The address of the last value found is stored in convenience variable &lsquo;$_&rsquo;. A count of the number of matches is stored in &lsquo;$numfound&rsquo;.

<p>
	Whenever GDB prints a value memory will be allocated within GDB to hold the contents of the value. It is possible in some languages with dynamic typing systems, that an invalid program may indicate a value that is incorrectly large, this in turn may cause GDB to try and allocate an overly large amount of memory.
</p>
<ul>

	<li>set max&ndash;value&ndash;size unlimited</li>

		Set the maximum size of memory that GDB will allocate for the contents of a value to bytes, trying to display a value that requires more memory than that will result in an error.
	</p>
	<p>
		Setting this variable does not effect values that have already been allocated within GDB, only future allocations.
	</p>
	<p>
		There&rsquo;s a minimum size that max&ndash;value&ndash;size can be set to in order that GDB can still operate correctly, this minimum is currently 16 bytes.

		The limit applies to the results of some subexpressions as well as to complete expressions. For example, an expression denoting a simple integer component, such as x.y.z, may fail if the size of x.y is dynamic and exceeds bytes. On the other hand, GDB is sometimes clever; the expression A[i], where A is an array variable with non&ndash;constant size, will generally succeed regardless of the bounds on A, as long as the component size is less than bytes.

<p>
	Almost all compilers support optimization. With optimization disabled, the compiler generates assembly code that corresponds directly to your source code, in a simplistic way. As the compiler applies more powerful optimizations, the generated assembly code diverges from your original source code. With help from debugging information generated by the compiler, GDB can map from the running program back to constructs from your original source.
</p>
<p>
	GDB is more accurate with optimization disabled. If you can recompile without optimization, it is easier to follow the progress of your program during debugging. But, there are many cases where you may need to debug an optimized version.
</p>
<p>
	When you debug a program compiled with &lsquo;&ndash;g &ndash;O&rsquo;, remember that the optimizer has rearranged your code; the debugger shows you what is really there. Do not be too surprised when the execution path does not exactly match your source file! An extreme example: if you define a variable, but never use it, GDB never sees that variable&mdash;because the compiler optimizes it out of existence.
</p>
<p>
	Some things do not work as well with &lsquo;&ndash;g &ndash;O&rsquo; as with just &lsquo;&ndash;g&rsquo;, particularly on machines with instruction scheduling. If in doubt, recompile with &lsquo;&ndash;g&rsquo; alone, and if this fixes the problem, please report it to us as a bug (including a test case!). See Variables, for more information about debugging optimized code.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_7a042571" href="#TOC_HEAD_7a042571">11.1 Inline Functions</a></H2><ul><a href="../tags/inline.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>inline</a>&nbsp;</ul>
<p>
	Inlining is an optimization that inserts a copy of the function body directly at each call site, instead of jumping to a shared routine. GDB displays inlined functions just like non&ndash;inlined functions. They appear in backtraces. You can view their arguments and local variables, step into them with step, skip them with next, and escape from them with finish. You can check whether a function was inlined by using the info frame command.
</p>
<p>
	For GDB to support inlined functions, the compiler must record information about inlining in the debug information &mdash; GCC using the DWARF 2 format does this, and several other compilers do also. GDB only supports inlined functions when using DWARF 2. Versions of GCC before 4.1 do not emit two required attributes (&lsquo;DW_AT_call_file&rsquo; and &lsquo;DW_AT_call_line&rsquo;); GDB does not display inlined function calls with earlier versions of GCC. It instead displays the arguments and local variables of inlined functions as local variables in the caller.
</p>
<p>
	The body of an inlined function is directly included at its call site; unlike a non&ndash;inlined function, there are no instructions devoted to the call. GDB still pretends that the call site and the start of the inlined function are different instructions. Stepping to the call site shows the call site, and then stepping again shows the first line of the inlined function, even though no additional instructions are executed.
</p>
<p>
	This makes source&ndash;level debugging much clearer; you can see both the context of the call and then the effect of the call. Only stepping by a single instruction using stepi or nexti does not do this; single instruction steps always show the inlined body.
</p>
<p>
	There are some ways that GDB does not pretend that inlined function calls are the same as normal calls:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Setting breakpoints at the call site of an inlined function may not work, because the call site does not contain any code. GDB may incorrectly move the breakpoint to the next line of the enclosing function, after the call. This limitation will be removed in a future version of GDB; until then, set a breakpoint on an earlier line or inside the inlined function instead.</li>
	<li>GDB cannot locate the return value of inlined calls after using the finish command. This is a limitation of compiler&ndash;generated debugging information; after finish, you can step to the next line and print a variable where your program stored the return value.</li>
	<br />
</ul>

<p>
	Function B can call function C in its very last statement. In unoptimized compilation the call of C is immediately followed by return instruction at the end of B code. Optimizing compiler may replace the call and return in function B into one jump to function C instead. Such use of a jump instruction is called tail call.
</p>
<p>
	During execution of function C, there will be no indication in the function call stack frames that it was tail&ndash;called from B. If function A regularly calls function B which tail&ndash;calls function C, then GDB will see A as the caller of C. However, in some cases GDB can determine that C was tail&ndash;called from B, and it will then create fictitious call frame for that, with the return address set up as if B called C normally.
</p>
<p>
	This functionality is currently supported only by DWARF 2 debugging format and the compiler has to produce &lsquo;DW_TAG_call_site&rsquo; tags. With GCC, you need to specify &ndash;O &ndash;g during compilation, to get this information.
</p>
<p>
	info frame command (see Frame Info) will indicate the tail call frame kind by text tail call frame such as in this sample GDB output:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) x/i $pc - 2
0x40066b &lt;b(int, double)+11&gt;: jmp 0x400640 &lt;c(int, double)&gt;
(gdb) info frame
Stack level 1, frame at 0x7fffffffda30:
rip = 0x40066d in b (amd64-entry-value.cc:59); saved rip 0x4004c5
tail call frame, caller of frame at 0x7fffffffda30
source language c++.
Arglist at unknown address.
Locals at unknown address, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffda30</code></pre>
<p>
	The detection of all the possible code path executions can find them ambiguous. There is no execution history stored (possible Reverse Execution is never used for this purpose) and the last known caller could have reached the known callee by multiple different jump sequences. In such case GDB still tries to show at least all the unambiguous top tail callers and all the unambiguous bottom tail calees, if any.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set debug entry&ndash;values</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When set to on, enables printing of analysis messages for both frame argument values at function entry and tail calls. It will show all the possible valid tail calls code paths it has considered. It will also print the intersection of them with the final unambiguous (possibly partial or even empty) code path result.
	</p>
	<li>show debug entry&ndash;values</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of analysis messages printing for both frame argument values at function entry and tail calls.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The analysis messages for tail calls can for example show why the virtual tail call frame for function c has not been recognized (due to the indirect reference by variable x):
</p>
<pre><code>static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void);
void (*x) (void) = c;
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (void) { x++; }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void) { a (); }
int main (void) { x (); return 0; }

Breakpoint 1, DW_OP_entry_value resolving cannot find
DW_TAG_call_site 0x40039a in main
a () at t.c:3
3	static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (void) { x++; }
(gdb) bt
#0  a () at t.c:3
#1  0x000000000040039a in main () at t.c:5</code></pre>
<p>
	Another possibility is an ambiguous virtual tail call frames resolution:
</p>
<pre><code>int i;
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) f (void) { i++; }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) e (void) { f (); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) d (void) { f (); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void) { d (); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) b (void)
{ if (i) c (); else e (); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (void) { b (); }
int main (void) { a (); return 0; }

tailcall: initial: 0x4004d2(a) 0x4004ce(b) 0x4004b2(c) 0x4004a2(d)
tailcall: compare: 0x4004d2(a) 0x4004cc(b) 0x400492(e)
tailcall: reduced: 0x4004d2(a) |
(gdb) bt
#0  f () at t.c:2
#1  0x00000000004004d2 in a () at t.c:8
#2  0x0000000000400395 in main () at t.c:9</code></pre>
<p>
	Frames #0 and #2 are real, #1 is a virtual tail call frame. The code can have possible execution paths main&rarr;a&rarr;b&rarr;c&rarr;d&rarr;f or main&rarr;a&rarr;b&rarr;e&rarr;f, GDB cannot find which one from the inferior state.
</p>
<p>
	initial: state shows some random possible calling sequence GDB has found. It then finds another possible calling sequence &ndash; that one is prefixed by compare:. The non&ndash;ambiguous intersection of these two is printed as the reduced: calling sequence. That one could have many further compare: and reduced: statements as long as there remain any non&ndash;ambiguous sequence entries.
</p>
<p>
	For the frame of function b in both cases there are different possible $pc values (0x4004cc or 0x4004ce), therefore this frame is also ambiguous. The only non&ndash;ambiguous frame is the one for function a, therefore this one is displayed to the user while the ambiguous frames are omitted.
</p>
<p>
	There can be also reasons why printing of frame argument values at function entry may fail:
</p>
<pre><code>int v;
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (int i) { v++; }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (int i);
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) b (int i) { a (i); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (int i)
{ if (i) b (i - 1); else c (0); }
int main (void) { a (5); return 0; }

(gdb) bt
#0  c (i=i@entry=0) at t.c:2
#1  0x0000000000400428 in a (DW_OP_entry_value resolving has found
function "a" at 0x400420 can call itself via tail calls
i=&lt;optimized out&gt;) at t.c:6
#2  0x000000000040036e in main () at t.c:7</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB cannot find out from the inferior state if and how many times did function a call itself (via function b) as these calls would be tail calls. Such tail calls would modify the i variable, therefore GDB cannot be sure the value it knows would be right &ndash; GDB prints &lt;optimized out&gt; instead.

	<H1><a name="GDB-USER-MANUAL-MACRO-1" href="#TOC_GDB-USER-MANUAL-MACRO-1">12 C Preprocessor Macros</a></H1><ul><a href="../tags/Debug-macro.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>Debug-macro</a>&nbsp;</ul>
<p>
	Some languages, such as C and C++, provide a way to define and invoke &ldquo;preprocessor macros&rdquo; which expand into strings of tokens. GDB can evaluate expressions containing macro invocations, show the result of macro expansion, and show a macro&rsquo;s definition, including where it was defined.
</p>
<p>
	You may need to compile your program specially to provide GDB with information about preprocessor macros. Most compilers do not include macros in their debugging information, even when you compile with the &ndash;g flag. See Compilation.
</p>
<p>
	A program may define a macro at one point, remove that definition later, and then provide a different definition after that. Thus, at different points in the program, a macro may have different definitions, or have no definition at all. If there is a current stack frame, GDB uses the macros in scope at that frame&rsquo;s source code line. Otherwise, GDB uses the macros in scope at the current listing location; see List.
</p>
<p>
	Whenever GDB evaluates an expression, it always expands any macro invocations present in the expression. GDB also provides the following commands for working with macros explicitly.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>macro expand expression</li>
	<li>macro exp expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the results of expanding all preprocessor macro invocations in expression. Since GDB simply expands macros, but does not parse the result, expression need not be a valid expression; it can be any string of tokens.
	</p>
	<li>macro expand&ndash;once expression</li>
	<li>macro exp1 expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		(This command is not yet implemented.) Show the results of expanding those preprocessor macro invocations that appear explicitly in expression. Macro invocations appearing in that expansion are left unchanged. This command allows you to see the effect of a particular macro more clearly, without being confused by further expansions. Since GDB simply expands macros, but does not parse the result, expression need not be a valid expression; it can be any string of tokens.
	</p>
	<li>info macro [&ndash;a|&ndash;all] [&ndash;&ndash;] macro</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current definition or all definitions of the named macro, and describe the source location or compiler command&ndash;line where that definition was established. The optional double dash is to signify the end of argument processing and the beginning of macro for non C&ndash;like macros where the macro may begin with a hyphen.
	</p>
	<li>info macros locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show all macro definitions that are in effect at the source line of the code location that results from resolving locspec, and describe the source location or compiler command&ndash;line where those definitions were established.
	</p>
	<li>macro define macro replacement&ndash;list</li>
	<li>macro define macro(arglist) replacement&ndash;list</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Introduce a definition for a preprocessor macro named macro, invocations of which are replaced by the tokens given in replacement&ndash;list. The first form of this command defines an &ldquo;object&ndash;like&rdquo; macro, which takes no arguments; the second form defines a &ldquo;function&ndash;like&rdquo; macro, which takes the arguments given in arglist.
	</p>
	<p>
		A definition introduced by this command is in scope in every expression evaluated in GDB, until it is removed with the macro undef command, described below. The definition overrides all definitions for macro present in the program being debugged, as well as any previous user&ndash;supplied definition.
	</p>
	<li>macro undef macro</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Remove any user&ndash;supplied definition for the macro named macro. This command only affects definitions provided with the macro define command, described above; it cannot remove definitions present in the program being debugged.
	</p>
	<li>macro list</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		List all the macros defined using the macro define command.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Here is a transcript showing the above commands in action. First, we show our source files:
</p>
<pre><code>$ cat sample.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "sample.h"

#define M 42
#define ADD(x) (M + x)

main ()
{
#define N 28
printf ("Hello, world!\n");
#undef N
printf ("We're so creative.\n");
#define N 1729
printf ("Goodbye, world!\n");
}
$ cat sample.h
#define Q &lt;
$</code></pre>
<p>
	Now, we compile the program using the GNU C compiler, GCC. We pass the &ndash;gdwarf&ndash;214 and &ndash;g3 flags to ensure the compiler includes information about preprocessor macros in the debugging information.
</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -gdwarf-2 -g3 sample.c -o sample
$</code></pre>
<p>
	Now, we start GDB on our sample program:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb -nw sample
GNU gdb 2002-05-06-cvs
Copyright 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
GDB is free software, …
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	We can expand macros and examine their definitions, even when the program is not running. GDB uses the current listing position to decide which macro definitions are in scope:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) list main
3
4       #define M 42
5       #define ADD(x) (M + x)
6
7       main ()
8       {
9       #define N 28
10        printf ("Hello, world!\n");
11      #undef N
12        printf ("We're so creative.\n");
(gdb) info macro ADD
Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:5
#define ADD(x) (M + x)
(gdb) info macro Q
Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.h:1
included at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:2
#define Q &lt;
(gdb) macro expand ADD(1)
expands to: (42 + 1)
(gdb) macro expand-once ADD(1)
expands to: once (M + 1)
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	In the example above, note that macro expand&ndash;once expands only the macro invocation explicit in the original text &mdash; the invocation of ADD &mdash; but does not expand the invocation of the macro M, which was introduced by ADD.
</p>
<p>
	Once the program is running, GDB uses the macro definitions in force at the source line of the current stack frame:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048370: file sample.c, line 10.
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample

Breakpoint 1, main () at sample.c:10
10        printf ("Hello, world!\n");
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	At line 10, the definition of the macro N at line 9 is in force:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info macro N
Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:9
#define N 28
(gdb) macro expand N Q M
expands to: 28 &lt; 42
(gdb) print N Q M
$1 = 1
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	As we step over directives that remove N&rsquo;s definition, and then give it a new definition, GDB finds the definition (or lack thereof) in force at each point:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) next
Hello, world!
12        printf ("We're so creative.\n");
(gdb) info macro N
The symbol `N' has no definition as a C/C++ preprocessor macro
at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:12
(gdb) next
We're so creative.
14        printf ("Goodbye, world!\n");
(gdb) info macro N
Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:13
#define N 1729
(gdb) macro expand N Q M
expands to: 1729 &lt; 42
(gdb) print N Q M
$2 = 0
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	In addition to source files, macros can be defined on the compilation command line using the &ndash;Dname=value syntax. For macros defined in such a way, GDB displays the location of their definition as line zero of the source file submitted to the compiler.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info macro __STDC__
Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:0
-D__STDC__=1
(gdb)</code></pre>

<p>
	In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt the program&rsquo;s execution long enough for the developer to learn anything helpful about its behavior. If the program&rsquo;s correctness depends on its real&ndash;time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger might cause the program to change its behavior drastically, or perhaps fail, even when the code itself is correct. It is useful to be able to observe the program&rsquo;s behavior without interrupting it.
</p>
<p>
	Using GDB&rsquo;s trace and collect commands, you can specify locations in the program, called tracepoints, and arbitrary expressions to evaluate when those tracepoints are reached. Later, using the tfind command, you can examine the values those expressions had when the program hit the tracepoints. The expressions may also denote objects in memory&mdash;structures or arrays, for example&mdash;whose values GDB should record; while visiting a particular tracepoint, you may inspect those objects as if they were in memory at that moment. However, because GDB records these values without interacting with you, it can do so quickly and unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing the program&rsquo;s behavior.
</p>
<p>
	The tracepoint facility is currently available only for remote targets. See Targets. In addition, your remote target must know how to collect trace data. This functionality is implemented in the remote stub; however, none of the stubs distributed with GDB support tracepoints as of this writing. The format of the remote packets used to implement tracepoints are described in Tracepoint Packets.
</p>
<p>
	It is also possible to get trace data from a file, in a manner reminiscent of corefiles; you specify the filename, and use tfind to search through the file. See Trace Files, for more details.
</p>
<p>
	This chapter describes the tracepoint commands and features.

</div>
<p>
	Before running such a trace experiment, an arbitrary number of tracepoints can be set. A tracepoint is actually a special type of breakpoint (see Set Breaks), so you can manipulate it using standard breakpoint commands. For instance, as with breakpoints, tracepoint numbers are successive integers starting from one, and many of the commands associated with tracepoints take the tracepoint number as their argument, to identify which tracepoint to work on.
</p>
<p>
	For each tracepoint, you can specify, in advance, some arbitrary set of data that you want the target to collect in the trace buffer when it hits that tracepoint. The collected data can include registers, local variables, or global data. Later, you can use GDB commands to examine the values these data had at the time the tracepoint was hit.
</p>
<p>
	Tracepoints do not support every breakpoint feature. Ignore counts on tracepoints have no effect, and tracepoints cannot run GDB commands when they are hit. Tracepoints may not be thread&ndash;specific either.
</p>
<p>
	Some targets may support fast tracepoints, which are inserted in a different way (such as with a jump instead of a trap), that is faster but possibly restricted in where they may be installed.
</p>
<p>
	Regular and fast tracepoints are dynamic tracing facilities, meaning that they can be used to insert tracepoints at (almost) any location in the target. Some targets may also support controlling static tracepoints from GDB. With static tracing, a set of instrumentation points, also known as markers, are embedded in the target program, and can be activated or deactivated by name or address. These are usually placed at locations which facilitate investigating what the target is actually doing. GDB&rsquo;s support for static tracing includes being able to list instrumentation points, and attach them with GDB defined high level tracepoints that expose the whole range of convenience of GDB&rsquo;s tracepoints support. Namely, support for collecting registers values and values of global or local (to the instrumentation point) variables; tracepoint conditions and trace state variables. The act of installing a GDB static tracepoint on an instrumentation point, or marker, is referred to as probing a static tracepoint marker.
</p>
<p>
	gdbserver supports tracepoints on some target systems. See Tracepoints support in gdbserver.
</p>
<p>
	This section describes commands to set tracepoints and associated conditions and actions.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_984e31a8" href="#TOC_HEAD_984e31a8">13.1.1 Create and Delete Tracepoints</a></H3>
<ul>
	<li>trace locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The trace command is very similar to the break command. Its argument locspec can be any valid location specification. See Location Specifications. The trace command defines a tracepoint, which is a point in the target program where the debugger will briefly stop, collect some data, and then allow the program to continue. Setting a tracepoint or changing its actions takes effect immediately if the remote stub supports the &lsquo;InstallInTrace&rsquo; feature (see install tracepoint in tracing). If remote stub doesn&rsquo;t support the &lsquo;InstallInTrace&rsquo; feature, all these changes don&rsquo;t take effect until the next tstart command, and once a trace experiment is running, further changes will not have any effect until the next trace experiment starts. In addition, GDB supports pending tracepoints&mdash;tracepoints whose address is not yet resolved. (This is similar to pending breakpoints.) Pending tracepoints are not downloaded to the target and not installed until they are resolved. The resolution of pending tracepoints requires GDB support&mdash;when debugging with the remote target, and GDB disconnects from the remote stub (see disconnected tracing), pending tracepoints can not be resolved (and downloaded to the remote stub) while GDB is disconnected.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here are some examples of using the trace command:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) trace foo.c:121    // a source file and line number

(gdb) trace +2           // 2 lines forward

(gdb) trace my_function  // first source line of function

(gdb) trace *my_function // EXACT start address of function

(gdb) trace *0x2117c4    // an address	</code></pre>
	<p>
		You can abbreviate trace as tr.
	</p>
	<li>trace locspec if cond</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a tracepoint with condition cond; evaluate the expression cond each time the tracepoint is reached, and collect data only if the value is nonzero&mdash;that is, if cond evaluates as true. See Tracepoint Conditions, for more information on tracepoint conditions.
	</p>
	<li>ftrace locspec [ if cond ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The ftrace command sets a fast tracepoint. For targets that support them, fast tracepoints will use a more efficient but possibly less general technique to trigger data collection, such as a jump instruction instead of a trap, or some sort of hardware support. It may not be possible to create a fast tracepoint at the desired location, in which case the command will exit with an explanatory message.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB handles arguments to ftrace exactly as for trace.
	</p>
	<p>
		On 32&ndash;bit x86&ndash;architecture systems, fast tracepoints normally need to be placed at an instruction that is 5 bytes or longer, but can be placed at 4&ndash;byte instructions if the low 64K of memory of the target program is available to install trampolines. Some Unix&ndash;type systems, such as GNU/Linux, exclude low addresses from the program&rsquo;s address space; but for instance with the Linux kernel it is possible to let GDB use this area by doing a sysctl command to set the mmap_min_addr kernel parameter, as in
	</p>
	<pre><code>sudo sysctl -w vm.mmap_min_addr=32768	</code></pre>
	<p>
		which sets the low address to 32K, which leaves plenty of room for trampolines. The minimum address should be set to a page boundary.
	</p>
	<li>strace [locspec | &ndash;m marker] [ if cond ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The strace command sets a static tracepoint. For targets that support it, setting a static tracepoint probes a static instrumentation point, or marker, found at the code locations that result from resolving locspec. It may not be possible to set a static tracepoint at the desired code location, in which case the command will exit with an explanatory message.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB handles arguments to strace exactly as for trace, with the addition that the user can also specify &ndash;m marker instead of a location spec. This probes the marker identified by the marker string identifier. This identifier depends on the static tracepoint backend library your program is using. You can find all the marker identifiers in the &lsquo;ID&rsquo; field of the info static&ndash;tracepoint&ndash;markers command output. See Listing Static Tracepoint Markers. For example, in the following small program using the UST tracing engine:
	</p>
	<pre><code>main ()
{
trace_mark(ust, bar33, "str %s", "FOOBAZ");
}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		the marker id is composed of joining the first two arguments to the trace_mark call with a slash, which translates to:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info static-tracepoint-markers
Cnt Enb ID         Address            What
1   n   ust/bar33  0x0000000000400ddc in main at stexample.c:22
        Data: "str %s"
[etc...]	</code></pre>
	<p>
		so you may probe the marker above with:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) strace -m ust/bar33	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Static tracepoints accept an extra collect action &mdash; collect $_sdata. This collects arbitrary user data passed in the probe point call to the tracing library. In the UST example above, you&rsquo;ll see that the third argument to trace_mark is a printf&ndash;like format string. The user data is then the result of running that formatting string against the following arguments. Note that info static&ndash;tracepoint&ndash;markers command output lists that format string in the &lsquo;Data:&rsquo; field.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can inspect this data when analyzing the trace buffer, by printing the $_sdata variable like any other variable available to GDB. See Tracepoint Action Lists.
	</p>
	<p>
		The convenience variable $tpnum records the tracepoint number of the most recently set tracepoint.
	</p>
	<li>delete tracepoint [num]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Permanently delete one or more tracepoints. With no argument, the default is to delete all tracepoints. Note that the regular delete command can remove tracepoints also.
	</p>
	<p>
		Examples:
	</p>

<p>
	These commands are deprecated; they are equivalent to plain disable and enable.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>disable tracepoint [num]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable tracepoint num, or all tracepoints if no argument num is given. A disabled tracepoint will have no effect during a trace experiment, but it is not forgotten. You can re&ndash;enable a disabled tracepoint using the enable tracepoint command. If the command is issued during a trace experiment and the debug target has support for disabling tracepoints during a trace experiment, then the change will be effective immediately. Otherwise, it will be applied to the next trace experiment.
	</p>
	<li>enable tracepoint [num]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable tracepoint num, or all tracepoints. If this command is issued during a trace experiment and the debug target supports enabling tracepoints during a trace experiment, then the enabled tracepoints will become effective immediately. Otherwise, they will become effective the next time a trace experiment is run.

<ul>
	<li>passcount [n [num]]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the passcount of a tracepoint. The passcount is a way to automatically stop a trace experiment. If a tracepoint&rsquo;s passcount is n, then the trace experiment will be automatically stopped on the n&rsquo;th time that tracepoint is hit. If the tracepoint number num is not specified, the passcount command sets the passcount of the most recently defined tracepoint. If no passcount is given, the trace experiment will run until stopped explicitly by the user.

		Examples:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) passcount 5 2 // Stop on the 5th execution of

	<H3><a name="HEAD_7c6aa018" href="#TOC_HEAD_7c6aa018">13.1.4 Tracepoint Conditions</a></H3>
<p>
	The simplest sort of tracepoint collects data every time your program reaches a specified place. You can also specify a condition for a tracepoint. A condition is just a Boolean expression in your programming language (see Expressions). A tracepoint with a condition evaluates the expression each time your program reaches it, and data collection happens only if the condition is true.
</p>
<p>
	Tracepoint conditions can be specified when a tracepoint is set, by using &lsquo;if&rsquo; in the arguments to the trace command. See Setting Tracepoints. They can also be set or changed at any time with the condition command, just as with breakpoints.
</p>
<p>
	Unlike breakpoint conditions, GDB does not actually evaluate the conditional expression itself. Instead, GDB encodes the expression into an agent expression (see Agent Expressions) suitable for execution on the target, independently of GDB. Global variables become raw memory locations, locals become stack accesses, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
	For instance, suppose you have a function that is usually called frequently, but should not be called after an error has occurred. You could use the following tracepoint command to collect data about calls of that function that happen while the error code is propagating through the program; an unconditional tracepoint could end up collecting thousands of useless trace frames that you would have to search through.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) trace normal_operation if errcode &gt; 0</code></pre>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_eaeb7639" href="#TOC_HEAD_eaeb7639">13.1.5 Trace State Variables</a></H3>
<p>
	A trace state variable is a special type of variable that is created and managed by target&ndash;side code. The syntax is the same as that for GDB&rsquo;s convenience variables (a string prefixed with &ldquo;$&rdquo;), but they are stored on the target. They must be created explicitly, using a tvariable command. They are always 64&ndash;bit signed integers.
</p>
<p>
	Trace state variables are remembered by GDB, and downloaded to the target along with tracepoint information when the trace experiment starts. There are no intrinsic limits on the number of trace state variables, beyond memory limitations of the target.
</p>
<p>
	Although trace state variables are managed by the target, you can use them in print commands and expressions as if they were convenience variables; GDB will get the current value from the target while the trace experiment is running. Trace state variables share the same namespace as other &ldquo;$&rdquo; variables, which means that you cannot have trace state variables with names like $23 or $pc, nor can you have a trace state variable and a convenience variable with the same name.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>tvariable $name [ = expression ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The tvariable command creates a new trace state variable named $name, and optionally gives it an initial value of expression. The expression is evaluated when this command is entered; the result will be converted to an integer if possible, otherwise GDB will report an error. A subsequent tvariable command specifying the same name does not create a variable, but instead assigns the supplied initial value to the existing variable of that name, overwriting any previous initial value. The default initial value is 0.
	</p>
	<li>info tvariables</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		List all the trace state variables along with their initial values. Their current values may also be displayed, if the trace experiment is currently running.
	</p>
	<li>delete tvariable [ $name &hellip; ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Delete the given trace state variables, or all of them if no arguments are specified.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_5cf7306d" href="#TOC_HEAD_5cf7306d">13.1.6 Tracepoint Action Lists</a></H3>
<ul>
	<li>actions [num]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command will prompt for a list of actions to be taken when the tracepoint is hit. If the tracepoint number num is not specified, this command sets the actions for the one that was most recently defined (so that you can define a tracepoint and then say actions without bothering about its number). You specify the actions themselves on the following lines, one action at a time, and terminate the actions list with a line containing just end. So far, the only defined actions are collect, teval, and while&ndash;stepping.
	</p>
	<p>
		actions is actually equivalent to commands (see Breakpoint Command Lists), except that only the defined actions are allowed; any other GDB command is rejected.
	</p>
	<p>
		To remove all actions from a tracepoint, type &lsquo;actions num&rsquo; and follow it immediately with &lsquo;end&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) collect data // collect some data

(gdb) while-stepping 5 // single-step 5 times, collect data

(gdb) end              // signals the end of actions.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In the following example, the action list begins with collect commands indicating the things to be collected when the tracepoint is hit. Then, in order to single&ndash;step and collect additional data following the tracepoint, a while&ndash;stepping command is used, followed by the list of things to be collected after each step in a sequence of single steps. The while&ndash;stepping command is terminated by its own separate end command. Lastly, the action list is terminated by an end command.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) trace foo
(gdb) actions
Enter actions for tracepoint 1, one per line:
&gt; collect bar,baz
&gt; collect $regs
&gt; while-stepping 12
&gt; collect $pc, arr[i]
&gt; end
end	</code></pre>
	<li>collect[/mods] expr1, expr2, &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Collect values of the given expressions when the tracepoint is hit. This command accepts a comma&ndash;separated list of any valid expressions. In addition to global, static, or local variables, the following special arguments are supported:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>$regs</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Collect all registers.
		</p>
		<li>$args</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Collect all function arguments.
		</p>
		<li>$locals</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Collect all local variables.
		</p>
		<li>$_ret</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Collect the return address. This is helpful if you want to see more of a backtrace.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note: The return address location can not always be reliably determined up front, and the wrong address / registers may end up collected instead. On some architectures the reliability is higher for tracepoints at function entry, while on others it&rsquo;s the opposite. When this happens, backtracing will stop because the return address is found unavailable (unless another collect rule happened to match it).
		</p>
		<li>$_probe_argc</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Collects the number of arguments from the static probe at which the tracepoint is located. See Static Probe Points.
		</p>
		<li>$_probe_argn</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			n is an integer between 0 and 11. Collects the nth argument from the static probe at which the tracepoint is located. See Static Probe Points.
		</p>
		<li>$_sdata</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Collect static tracepoint marker specific data. Only available for static tracepoints. See Tracepoint Action Lists. On the UST static tracepoints library backend, an instrumentation point resembles a printf function call. The tracing library is able to collect user specified data formatted to a character string using the format provided by the programmer that instrumented the program. Other backends have similar mechanisms. Here&rsquo;s an example of a UST marker call:
		</p>
		<p>
			const char master_name[] = &quot;$your_name&quot;;
			trace_mark(channel1, marker1, &quot;hello %s&quot;, master_name)
		</p>
		<p>
			In this case, collecting $_sdata collects the string &lsquo;hello $yourname&rsquo;. When analyzing the trace buffer, you can inspect &lsquo;$_sdata&rsquo; like any other variable available to GDB.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You can give several consecutive collect commands, each one with a single argument, or one collect command with several arguments separated by commas; the effect is the same.
	</p>
	<p>
		The optional mods changes the usual handling of the arguments. s requests that pointers to chars be handled as strings, in particular collecting the contents of the memory being pointed at, up to the first zero. The upper bound is by default the value of the print characters variable; if s is followed by a decimal number, that is the upper bound instead. So for instance &lsquo;collect/s25 mystr&rsquo; collects as many as 25 characters at &lsquo;mystr&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		The command info scope (see info scope) is particularly useful for figuring out what data to collect.
	</p>
	<li>teval expr1, expr2, &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Evaluate the given expressions when the tracepoint is hit. This command accepts a comma&ndash;separated list of expressions. The results are discarded, so this is mainly useful for assigning values to trace state variables (see Trace State Variables) without adding those values to the trace buffer, as would be the case if the collect action were used.
	</p>
	<li>while&ndash;stepping n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Perform n single&ndash;step instruction traces after the tracepoint, collecting new data after each step. The while&ndash;stepping command is followed by the list of what to collect while stepping (followed by its own end command):
	</p>
	<pre><code>&gt; while-stepping 12
&gt; collect $regs, myglobal
&gt; end
&gt;	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note that $pc is not automatically collected by while&ndash;stepping; you need to explicitly collect that register if you need it. You may abbreviate while&ndash;stepping as ws or stepping.
	</p>
	<li>set default&ndash;collect expr1, expr2, &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This variable is a list of expressions to collect at each tracepoint hit. It is effectively an additional collect action prepended to every tracepoint action list. The expressions are parsed individually for each tracepoint, so for instance a variable named xyz may be interpreted as a global for one tracepoint, and a local for another, as appropriate to the tracepoint&rsquo;s location.
	</p>
	<li>show default&ndash;collect</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the list of expressions that are collected by default at each tracepoint hit.

<ul>
	<li>tstart</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command starts the trace experiment, and begins collecting data. It has the side effect of discarding all the data collected in the trace buffer during the previous trace experiment. If any arguments are supplied, they are taken as a note and stored with the trace experiment&rsquo;s state. The notes may be arbitrary text, and are especially useful with disconnected tracing in a multi&ndash;user context; the notes can explain what the trace is doing, supply user contact information, and so forth.
	</p>
	<li>tstop</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command stops the trace experiment. If any arguments are supplied, they are recorded with the experiment as a note. This is useful if you are stopping a trace started by someone else, for instance if the trace is interfering with the system&rsquo;s behavior and needs to be stopped quickly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: a trace experiment and data collection may stop automatically if any tracepoint&rsquo;s passcount is reached (see Tracepoint Passcounts), or if the trace buffer becomes full.
	</p>
	<li>tstatus</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command displays the status of the current trace data collection.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Here is an example of the commands we described so far:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) trace gdb_c_test
(gdb) actions
Enter actions for tracepoint #1, one per line.
&gt; collect $regs,$locals,$args
&gt; while-stepping 11
&gt; collect $regs
&gt; end
&gt; end
(gdb) tstart
    [time passes …]
(gdb) tstop</code></pre>
<p>
	You can choose to continue running the trace experiment even if GDB disconnects from the target, voluntarily or involuntarily. For commands such as detach, the debugger will ask what you want to do with the trace. But for unexpected terminations (GDB crash, network outage), it would be unfortunate to lose hard&ndash;won trace data, so the variable disconnected&ndash;tracing lets you decide whether the trace should continue running without GDB.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set disconnected&ndash;tracing on</li>
	<li>set disconnected&ndash;tracing off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Choose whether a tracing run should continue to run if GDB has disconnected from the target. Note that detach or quit will ask you directly what to do about a running trace no matter what this variable&rsquo;s setting, so the variable is mainly useful for handling unexpected situations, such as loss of the network.
	</p>
	<li>show disconnected&ndash;tracing</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current choice for disconnected tracing.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	When you reconnect to the target, the trace experiment may or may not still be running; it might have filled the trace buffer in the meantime, or stopped for one of the other reasons. If it is running, it will continue after reconnection.
</p>
<p>
	Upon reconnection, the target will upload information about the tracepoints in effect. GDB will then compare that information to the set of tracepoints currently defined, and attempt to match them up, allowing for the possibility that the numbers may have changed due to creation and deletion in the meantime. If one of the target&rsquo;s tracepoints does not match any in GDB, the debugger will create a new tracepoint, so that you have a number with which to specify that tracepoint. This matching&ndash;up process is necessarily heuristic, and it may result in useless tracepoints being created; you may simply delete them if they are of no use.
</p>
<p>
	If your target agent supports a circular trace buffer, then you can run a trace experiment indefinitely without filling the trace buffer; when space runs out, the agent deletes already&ndash;collected trace frames, oldest first, until there is enough room to continue collecting. This is especially useful if your tracepoints are being hit too often, and your trace gets terminated prematurely because the buffer is full. To ask for a circular trace buffer, simply set &lsquo;circular&ndash;trace&ndash;buffer&rsquo; to on. You can set this at any time, including during tracing; if the agent can do it, it will change buffer handling on the fly, otherwise it will not take effect until the next run.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set circular&ndash;trace&ndash;buffer on</li>
	<li>set circular&ndash;trace&ndash;buffer off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Choose whether a tracing run should use a linear or circular buffer for trace data. A linear buffer will not lose any trace data, but may fill up prematurely, while a circular buffer will discard old trace data, but it will have always room for the latest tracepoint hits.
	</p>
	<li>show circular&ndash;trace&ndash;buffer</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current choice for the trace buffer. Note that this may not match the agent&rsquo;s current buffer handling, nor is it guaranteed to match the setting that might have been in effect during a past run, for instance if you are looking at frames from a trace file.
	</p>
	<li>set trace&ndash;buffer&ndash;size n</li>
	<li>set trace&ndash;buffer&ndash;size unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Request that the target use a trace buffer of n bytes. Not all targets will honor the request; they may have a compiled&ndash;in size for the trace buffer, or some other limitation. Set to a value of unlimited or &ndash;1 to let the target use whatever size it likes. This is also the default.
	</p>
	<li>show trace&ndash;buffer&ndash;size</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current requested size for the trace buffer. Note that this will only match the actual size if the target supports size&ndash;setting, and was able to handle the requested size. For instance, if the target can only change buffer size between runs, this variable will not reflect the change until the next run starts. Use tstatus to get a report of the actual buffer size.
	</p>
	<li>set trace&ndash;user text</li>
	<li>show trace&ndash;user</li>
	<li>set trace&ndash;notes text</li>

	<p>
		Show the trace run&rsquo;s notes.
	</p>
	<li>set trace&ndash;stop&ndash;notes text</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the trace run&rsquo;s stop notes. The handling of the note is as for tstop arguments; the set command is convenient way to fix a stop note that is mistaken or incomplete.
	</p>

	<br />
	<p>

	<H3><a name="HEAD_5e22d5e4" href="#TOC_HEAD_5e22d5e4">13.1.10 Tracepoint Restrictions</a></H3>
<p>
	There are a number of restrictions on the use of tracepoints. As described above, tracepoint data gathering occurs on the target without interaction from GDB. Thus the full capabilities of the debugger are not available during data gathering, and then at data examination time, you will be limited by only having what was collected. The following items describe some common problems, but it is not exhaustive, and you may run into additional difficulties not mentioned here.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tracepoint expressions are intended to gather objects (lvalues). Thus the full flexibility of GDB&rsquo;s expression evaluator is not available. You cannot call functions, cast objects to aggregate types, access convenience variables or modify values (except by assignment to trace state variables). Some language features may implicitly call functions (for instance Objective&ndash;C fields with accessors), and therefore cannot be collected either.</li>
	<li>Collection of local variables, either individually or in bulk with $locals or $args, during while&ndash;stepping may behave erratically. The stepping action may enter a new scope (for instance by stepping into a function), or the location of the variable may change (for instance it is loaded into a register). The tracepoint data recorded uses the location information for the variables that is correct for the tracepoint location. When the tracepoint is created, it is not possible, in general, to determine where the steps of a while&ndash;stepping sequence will advance the program&mdash;particularly if a conditional branch is stepped.</li>
	<li>Collection of an incompletely&ndash;initialized or partially&ndash;destroyed object may result in something that GDB cannot display, or displays in a misleading way.</li>
	<li>When GDB displays a pointer to character it automatically dereferences the pointer to also display characters of the string being pointed to. However, collecting the pointer during tracing does not automatically collect the string. You need to explicitly dereference the pointer and provide size information if you want to collect not only the pointer, but the memory pointed to. For example, *ptr@50 can be used to collect the 50 element array pointed to by ptr.</li>
	<li>It is not possible to collect a complete stack backtrace at a tracepoint. Instead, you may collect the registers and a few hundred bytes from the stack pointer with something like *(unsigned char *)$esp@300 (adjust to use the name of the actual stack pointer register on your target architecture, and the amount of stack you wish to capture). Then the backtrace command will show a partial backtrace when using a trace frame. The number of stack frames that can be examined depends on the sizes of the frames in the collected stack.

	<li>If you do not collect registers at a tracepoint, GDB can infer that the value of $pc must be the same as the address of the tracepoint and use that when you are looking at a trace frame for that tracepoint. However, this cannot work if the tracepoint has multiple locations (for instance if it was set in a function that was inlined), or if it has a while&ndash;stepping loop. In those cases GDB will warn you that it can&rsquo;t infer $pc, and default it to zero.</li>

	After the tracepoint experiment ends, you use GDB commands for examining the trace data. The basic idea is that each tracepoint collects a trace snapshot every time it is hit and another snapshot every time it single&ndash;steps. All these snapshots are consecutively numbered from zero and go into a buffer, and you can examine them later. The way you examine them is to focus on a specific trace snapshot. When the remote stub is focused on a trace snapshot, it will respond to all GDB requests for memory and registers by reading from the buffer which belongs to that snapshot, rather than from real memory or registers of the program being debugged. This means that all GDB commands (print, info registers, backtrace, etc.) will behave as if we were currently debugging the program state as it was when the tracepoint occurred. Any requests for data that are not in the buffer will fail.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_24f1fbc4" href="#TOC_HEAD_24f1fbc4">13.2.1 tfind n</a></H3>
<p>
	The basic command for selecting a trace snapshot from the buffer is tfind n, which finds trace snapshot number n, counting from zero. If no argument n is given, the next snapshot is selected.
</p>
<p>
	Here are the various forms of using the tfind command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>tfind start</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Find the first snapshot in the buffer. This is a synonym for tfind 0 (since 0 is the number of the first snapshot).
	</p>
	<li>tfind none</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Stop debugging trace snapshots, resume live debugging.
	</p>
	<li>tfind end</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Same as &lsquo;tfind none&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>tfind</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		No argument means find the next trace snapshot or find the first one if no trace snapshot is selected.
	</p>
	<li>tfind &ndash;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Find the previous trace snapshot before the current one. This permits retracing earlier steps.
	</p>
	<li>tfind tracepoint num</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Find the next snapshot associated with tracepoint num. Search proceeds forward from the last examined trace snapshot. If no argument num is given, it means find the next snapshot collected for the same tracepoint as the current snapshot.
	</p>
	<li>tfind pc addr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Find the next snapshot associated with the value addr of the program counter. Search proceeds forward from the last examined trace snapshot. If no argument addr is given, it means find the next snapshot with the same value of PC as the current snapshot.
	</p>
	<li>tfind outside addr1, addr2</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Find the next snapshot whose PC is outside the given range of addresses (exclusive).
	</p>
	<li>tfind range addr1, addr2</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Find the next snapshot whose PC is between addr1 and addr2 (inclusive).
	</p>
	<li>tfind line [file:]n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Find the next snapshot associated with the source line n. If the optional argument file is given, refer to line n in that source file. Search proceeds forward from the last examined trace snapshot. If no argument n is given, it means find the next line other than the one currently being examined; thus saying tfind line repeatedly can appear to have the same effect as stepping from line to line in a live debugging session.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The default arguments for the tfind commands are specifically designed to make it easy to scan through the trace buffer. For instance, tfind with no argument selects the next trace snapshot, and tfind &ndash; with no argument selects the previous trace snapshot. So, by giving one tfind command, and then simply hitting RET repeatedly you can examine all the trace snapshots in order. Or, by saying tfind &ndash; and then hitting RET repeatedly you can examine the snapshots in reverse order. The tfind line command with no argument selects the snapshot for the next source line executed. The tfind pc command with no argument selects the next snapshot with the same program counter (PC) as the current frame. The tfind tracepoint command with no argument selects the next trace snapshot collected by the same tracepoint as the current one.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to letting you scan through the trace buffer manually, these commands make it easy to construct GDB scripts that scan through the trace buffer and print out whatever collected data you are interested in. Thus, if we want to examine the PC, FP, and SP registers from each trace frame in the buffer, we can say this:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) tfind start
(gdb) while ($trace_frame != -1)
&gt; printf "Frame %d, PC = %08X, SP = %08X, FP = %08X\n", \
        $trace_frame, $pc, $sp, $fp
&gt; tfind
&gt; end

Frame 0, PC = 0020DC64, SP = 0030BF3C, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 1, PC = 0020DC6C, SP = 0030BF38, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 2, PC = 0020DC70, SP = 0030BF34, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 3, PC = 0020DC74, SP = 0030BF30, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 4, PC = 0020DC78, SP = 0030BF2C, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 5, PC = 0020DC7C, SP = 0030BF28, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 6, PC = 0020DC80, SP = 0030BF24, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 7, PC = 0020DC84, SP = 0030BF20, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 8, PC = 0020DC88, SP = 0030BF1C, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 9, PC = 0020DC8E, SP = 0030BF18, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 10, PC = 00203F6C, SP = 0030BE3C, FP = 0030BF14</code></pre>
<p>
	Or, if we want to examine the variable X at each source line in the buffer:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) tfind start
(gdb) while ($trace_frame != -1)
&gt; printf "Frame %d, X == %d\n", $trace_frame, X
&gt; tfind line

Frame 0, X = 1
Frame 7, X = 2

	tdump works by scanning the tracepoint&rsquo;s current collection actions and printing the value of each expression listed. So tdump can fail, if after a run, you change the tracepoint&rsquo;s actions to mention variables that were not collected during the run.
</p>
<p>
	Also, for tracepoints with while&ndash;stepping loops, tdump uses the collected value of $pc to distinguish between trace frames that were collected at the tracepoint hit, and frames that were collected while stepping. This allows it to correctly choose whether to display the basic list of collections, or the collections from the body of the while&ndash;stepping loop. However, if $pc was not collected, then tdump will always attempt to dump using the basic collection list, and may fail if a while&ndash;stepping frame does not include all the same data that is collected at the tracepoint hit.

<p>
	In some situations, the target running a trace experiment may no longer be available; perhaps it crashed, or the hardware was needed for a different activity. To handle these cases, you can arrange to dump the trace data into a file, and later use that file as a source of trace data, via the target tfile command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>tsave [ &ndash;r ] filename</li>
	<li>tsave [&ndash;ctf] dirname</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Save the trace data to filename. By default, this command assumes that filename refers to the host filesystem, so if necessary GDB will copy raw trace data up from the target and then save it. If the target supports it, you can also supply the optional argument &ndash;r (&ldquo;remote&rdquo;) to direct the target to save the data directly into filename in its own filesystem, which may be more efficient if the trace buffer is very large. (Note, however, that target tfile can only read from files accessible to the host.) By default, this command will save trace frame in tfile format. You can supply the optional argument &ndash;ctf to save data in CTF format. The Common Trace Format (CTF) is proposed as a trace format that can be shared by multiple debugging and tracing tools. Please go to &lsquo;http://www.efficios.com/ctf&rsquo; to get more information.
	</p>
	<li>target tfile filename</li>
	<li>target ctf dirname</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use the file named filename or directory named dirname as a source of trace data. Commands that examine data work as they do with a live target, but it is not possible to run any new trace experiments. tstatus will report the state of the trace run at the moment the data was saved, as well as the current trace frame you are examining. Both filename and dirname must be on a filesystem accessible to the host.

<p>
	If your program is too large to fit completely in your target system&rsquo;s memory, you can sometimes use overlays to work around this problem. GDB provides some support for debugging programs that use overlays.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_b9c1c484" href="#TOC_HEAD_b9c1c484">14.1 How Overlays Work</a></H2>
<p>
	Suppose you have a computer whose instruction address space is only 64 kilobytes long, but which has much more memory which can be accessed by other means: special instructions, segment registers, or memory management hardware, for example. Suppose further that you want to adapt a program which is larger than 64 kilobytes to run on this system.
</p>
<p>
	One solution is to identify modules of your program which are relatively independent, and need not call each other directly; call these modules overlays. Separate the overlays from the main program, and place their machine code in the larger memory. Place your main program in instruction memory, but leave at least enough space there to hold the largest overlay as well.
</p>
<p>
	Now, to call a function located in an overlay, you must first copy that overlay&rsquo;s machine code from the large memory into the space set aside for it in the instruction memory, and then jump to its entry point there.
</p>

                    A code overlay</code></pre>
<p>
	The diagram (see A code overlay) shows a system with separate data and instruction address spaces. To map an overlay, the program copies its code from the larger address space to the instruction address space. Since the overlays shown here all use the same mapped address, only one may be mapped at a time. For a system with a single address space for data and instructions, the diagram would be similar, except that the program variables and heap would share an address space with the main program and the overlay area.
</p>
<p>
	An overlay loaded into instruction memory and ready for use is called a mapped overlay; its mapped address is its address in the instruction memory. An overlay not present (or only partially present) in instruction memory is called unmapped; its load address is its address in the larger memory. The mapped address is also called the virtual memory address, or VMA; the load address is also called the load memory address, or LMA.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, overlays are not a completely transparent way to adapt a program to limited instruction memory. They introduce a new set of global constraints you must keep in mind as you design your program:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Before calling or returning to a function in an overlay, your program must make sure that overlay is actually mapped. Otherwise, the call or return will transfer control to the right address, but in the wrong overlay, and your program will probably crash.</li>
	<li>If the process of mapping an overlay is expensive on your system, you will need to choose your overlays carefully to minimize their effect on your program&rsquo;s performance.</li>
	<li>The executable file you load onto your system must contain each overlay&rsquo;s instructions, appearing at the overlay&rsquo;s load address, not its mapped address. However, each overlay&rsquo;s instructions must be relocated and its symbols defined as if the overlay were at its mapped address. You can use GNU linker scripts to specify different load and relocation addresses for pieces of your program; see Overlay Description in Using ld: the GNU linker.</li>
	<li>The procedure for loading executable files onto your system must be able to load their contents into the larger address space as well as the instruction and data spaces.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	The overlay system described above is rather simple, and could be improved in many ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If your system has suitable bank switch registers or memory management hardware, you could use those facilities to make an overlay&rsquo;s load area contents simply appear at their mapped address in instruction space. This would probably be faster than copying the overlay to its mapped area in the usual way.</li>
	<li>If your overlays are small enough, you could set aside more than one overlay area, and have more than one overlay mapped at a time.</li>
	<li>You can use overlays to manage data, as well as instructions. In general, data overlays are even less transparent to your design than code overlays: whereas code overlays only require care when you call or return to functions, data overlays require care every time you access the data. Also, if you change the contents of a data overlay, you must copy its contents back out to its load address before you can copy a different data overlay into the same mapped area.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_c74c2c71" href="#TOC_HEAD_c74c2c71">14.2 Overlay Commands</a></H2>
<p>
	To use GDB&rsquo;s overlay support, each overlay in your program must correspond to a separate section of the executable file. The section&rsquo;s virtual memory address and load memory address must be the overlay&rsquo;s mapped and load addresses. Identifying overlays with sections allows GDB to determine the appropriate address of a function or variable, depending on whether the overlay is mapped or not.
</p>
<p>
	GDB&rsquo;s overlay commands all start with the word overlay; you can abbreviate this as ov or ovly. The commands are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>overlay off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable GDB&rsquo;s overlay support. When overlay support is disabled, GDB assumes that all functions and variables are always present at their mapped addresses. By default, GDB&rsquo;s overlay support is disabled.
	</p>
	<li>overlay manual</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable manual overlay debugging. In this mode, GDB relies on you to tell it which overlays are mapped, and which are not, using the overlay map&ndash;overlay and overlay unmap&ndash;overlay commands described below.
	</p>
	<li>overlay map&ndash;overlay overlay</li>
	<li>overlay map overlay</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB that overlay is now mapped; overlay must be the name of the object file section containing the overlay. When an overlay is mapped, GDB assumes it can find the overlay&rsquo;s functions and variables at their mapped addresses. GDB assumes that any other overlays whose mapped ranges overlap that of overlay are now unmapped.
	</p>
	<li>overlay unmap&ndash;overlay overlay</li>
	<li>overlay unmap overlay</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB that overlay is no longer mapped; overlay must be the name of the object file section containing the overlay. When an overlay is unmapped, GDB assumes it can find the overlay&rsquo;s functions and variables at their load addresses.
	</p>
	<li>overlay auto</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable automatic overlay debugging. In this mode, GDB consults a data structure the overlay manager maintains in the inferior to see which overlays are mapped. For details, see Automatic Overlay Debugging.
	</p>
	<li>overlay load&ndash;target</li>
	<li>overlay load</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Re&ndash;read the overlay table from the inferior. Normally, GDB re&ndash;reads the table GDB automatically each time the inferior stops, so this command should only be necessary if you have changed the overlay mapping yourself using GDB. This command is only useful when using automatic overlay debugging.
	</p>
	<li>overlay list&ndash;overlays</li>
	<li>overlay list</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display a list of the overlays currently mapped, along with their mapped addresses, load addresses, and sizes.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Normally, when GDB prints a code address, it includes the name of the function the address falls in:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print main
$3 = {int ()} 0x11a0 &lt;main&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	When overlay debugging is enabled, GDB recognizes code in unmapped overlays, and prints the names of unmapped functions with asterisks around them. For example, if foo is a function in an unmapped overlay, GDB prints it this way:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) overlay list
No sections are mapped.
(gdb) print foo
$5 = {int (int)} 0x100000 &lt;*foo*&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	When foo&rsquo;s overlay is mapped, GDB prints the function&rsquo;s name normally:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) overlay list
Section .ov.foo.text, loaded at 0x100000 - 0x100034,
        mapped at 0x1016 - 0x104a
(gdb) print foo
$6 = {int (int)} 0x1016 &lt;foo&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	When overlay debugging is enabled, GDB can find the correct address for functions and variables in an overlay, whether or not the overlay is mapped. This allows most GDB commands, like break and disassemble, to work normally, even on unmapped code. However, GDB&rsquo;s breakpoint support has some limitations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can set breakpoints in functions in unmapped overlays, as long as GDB can write to the overlay at its load address.</li>
	<li>GDB can not set hardware or simulator&ndash;based breakpoints in unmapped overlays. However, if you set a breakpoint at the end of your overlay manager (and tell GDB which overlays are now mapped, if you are using manual overlay management), GDB will re&ndash;set its breakpoints properly.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_7b2cbb11" href="#TOC_HEAD_7b2cbb11">14.3 Automatic Overlay Debugging</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB can automatically track which overlays are mapped and which are not, given some simple co&ndash;operation from the overlay manager in the inferior. If you enable automatic overlay debugging with the overlay auto command (see Overlay Commands), GDB looks in the inferior&rsquo;s memory for certain variables describing the current state of the overlays.
</p>
<p>
	Here are the variables your overlay manager must define to support GDB&rsquo;s automatic overlay debugging:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>ovly</em>table:</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This variable must be an array of the following structures:
	</p>
	<pre><code>struct
{
/* The overlay's mapped address.  */
unsigned long vma;

/* The size of the overlay, in bytes.  */
unsigned long size;

/* The overlay's load address.  */
unsigned long lma;

/* Non-zero if the overlay is currently mapped;
    zero otherwise.  */
unsigned long mapped;
}	</code></pre>
	<li>_novlys:</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This variable must be a four&ndash;byte signed integer, holding the total number of elements in <em>ovly</em>table.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	To decide whether a particular overlay is mapped or not, GDB looks for an entry in <em>ovly</em>table whose vma and lma members equal the VMA and LMA of the overlay&rsquo;s section in the executable file. When GDB finds a matching entry, it consults the entry&rsquo;s mapped member to determine whether the overlay is currently mapped.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, your overlay manager may define a function called <em>ovly</em>debug_event. If this function is defined, GDB will silently set a breakpoint there. If the overlay manager then calls this function whenever it has changed the overlay table, this will enable GDB to accurately keep track of which overlays are in program memory, and update any breakpoints that may be set in overlays. This will allow breakpoints to work even if the overlays are kept in ROM or other non&ndash;writable memory while they are not being executed.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_11c9ead5" href="#TOC_HEAD_11c9ead5">14.4 Overlay Sample Program</a></H2>
<p>
	When linking a program which uses overlays, you must place the overlays at their load addresses, while relocating them to run at their mapped addresses. To do this, you must write a linker script (see Overlay Description in Using ld: the GNU linker). Unfortunately, since linker scripts are specific to a particular host system, target architecture, and target memory layout, this manual cannot provide portable sample code demonstrating GDB&rsquo;s overlay support.
</p>
<p>
	However, the GDB source distribution does contain an overlaid program, with linker scripts for a few systems, as part of its test suite. The program consists of the following files from gdb/testsuite/gdb.base:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>overlays.c</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The main program file.
	</p>
	<li>ovlymgr.c</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		A simple overlay manager, used by overlays.c.
	</p>
	<li>foo.c</li>
	<li>bar.c</li>
	<li>baz.c</li>
	<li>grbx.c</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Overlay modules, loaded and used by overlays.c.
	</p>
	<li>d10v.ld</li>
	<li>m32r.ld</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Linker scripts for linking the test program on the d10v&ndash;elf and m32r&ndash;elf targets.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	You can build the test program using the d10v&ndash;elf GCC cross&ndash;compiler like this:
</p>
<pre><code>$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c overlays.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c ovlymgr.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c foo.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c bar.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c baz.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c grbx.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g overlays.o ovlymgr.o foo.o bar.o \
                baz.o grbx.o -Wl,-Td10v.ld -o overlays</code></pre>
<p>
	The build process is identical for any other architecture, except that you must substitute the appropriate compiler and linker script for the target system for d10v&ndash;elf&ndash;gcc and d10v.ld.
</p>
	<H1><a name="HEAD_efa578cd" href="#TOC_HEAD_efa578cd">15 Using GDB with Different Languages</a></H1>
<p>
	Although programming languages generally have common aspects, they are rarely expressed in the same manner. For instance, in ANSI C, dereferencing a pointer p is accomplished by *p, but in Modula&ndash;2, it is accomplished by p&circ;. Values can also be represented (and displayed) differently. Hex numbers in C appear as &lsquo;0x1ae&rsquo;, while in Modula&ndash;2 they appear as &lsquo;1AEH&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
	Language&ndash;specific information is built into GDB for some languages, allowing you to express operations like the above in your program&rsquo;s native language, and allowing GDB to output values in a manner consistent with the syntax of your program&rsquo;s native language. The language you use to build expressions is called the working language.

</div>
<p>
	There are two ways to control the working language&mdash;either have GDB set it automatically, or select it manually yourself. You can use the set language command for either purpose. On startup, GDB defaults to setting the language automatically. The working language is used to determine how expressions you type are interpreted, how values are printed, etc.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to the working language, every source file that GDB knows about has its own working language. For some object file formats, the compiler might indicate which language a particular source file is in. However, most of the time GDB infers the language from the name of the file. The language of a source file controls whether C++ names are demangled&mdash;this way backtrace can show each frame appropriately for its own language. There is no way to set the language of a source file from within GDB, but you can set the language associated with a filename extension. See Displaying the Language.
</p>
<p>
	This is most commonly a problem when you use a program, such as cfront or f2c, that generates C but is written in another language. In that case, make the program use #line directives in its C output; that way GDB will know the correct language of the source code of the original program, and will display that source code, not the generated C code.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_5deb9a42" href="#TOC_HEAD_5deb9a42">15.1.1 List of Filename Extensions and Languages</a></H3>
<p>
	If a source file name ends in one of the following extensions, then GDB infers that its language is the one indicated.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>.ada</li>
	<li>.ads</li>
	<li>.adb</li>
	<li>.a</li>

	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	In addition, you may set the language associated with a filename extension. See Displaying the Language.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_1214f07b" href="#TOC_HEAD_1214f07b">15.1.2 Setting the Working Language</a></H3>
<p>
	If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, expressions are interpreted the same way in your debugging session and your program.
</p>
<p>
	If you wish, you may set the language manually. To do this, issue the command &lsquo;set language lang&rsquo;, where lang is the name of a language, such as c or modula&ndash;2. For a list of the supported languages, type &lsquo;set language&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
	Setting the language manually prevents GDB from updating the working language automatically. This can lead to confusion if you try to debug a program when the working language is not the same as the source language, when an expression is acceptable to both languages&mdash;but means different things. For instance, if the current source file were written in C, and GDB was parsing Modula&ndash;2, a command such as:
</p>
<pre><code>print a = b + c</code></pre>
<p>
	might not have the effect you intended. In C, this means to add b and c and place the result in a. The result printed would be the value of a. In Modula&ndash;2, this means to compare a to the result of b+c, yielding a BOOLEAN value.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_195359da" href="#TOC_HEAD_195359da">15.1.3 Having GDB Infer the Source Language</a></H3>
<p>
	To have GDB set the working language automatically, use &lsquo;set language local&rsquo; or &lsquo;set language auto&rsquo;. GDB then infers the working language. That is, when your program stops in a frame (usually by encountering a breakpoint), GDB sets the working language to the language recorded for the function in that frame. If the language for a frame is unknown (that is, if the function or block corresponding to the frame was defined in a source file that does not have a recognized extension), the current working language is not changed, and GDB issues a warning.
</p>
<p>
	This may not seem necessary for most programs, which are written entirely in one source language. However, program modules and libraries written in one source language can be used by a main program written in a different source language. Using &lsquo;set language auto&rsquo; in this case frees you from having to set the working language manually.

<ul>

</menu>

</div>
<p>
	Some languages are designed to guard you against making seemingly common errors through a series of compile&ndash; and run&ndash;time checks. These include checking the type of arguments to functions and operators and making sure mathematical overflows are caught at run time. Checks such as these help to ensure a program&rsquo;s correctness once it has been compiled by eliminating type mismatches and providing active checks for range errors when your program is running.
</p>
<p>
	By default GDB checks for these errors according to the rules of the current source language. Although GDB does not check the statements in your program, it can check expressions entered directly into GDB for evaluation via the print command, for example.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_d7aab83f" href="#TOC_HEAD_d7aab83f">15.3.1 An Overview of Type Checking</a></H3>
<p>
	Some languages, such as C and C++, are strongly typed, meaning that the arguments to operators and functions have to be of the correct type, otherwise an error occurs. These checks prevent type mismatch errors from ever causing any run&ndash;time problems. For example,
</p>
<pre><code>int klass::my_method(char *b) { return  b ? 1 : 2; }

(gdb) print obj.my_method (0)
$1 = 2

but

(gdb) print obj.my_method (0x1234)
Cannot resolve method klass::my_method to any overloaded instance</code></pre>
<p>
	The second example fails because in C++ the integer constant &lsquo;0x1234&rsquo; is not type&ndash;compatible with the pointer parameter type.
</p>
<p>
	For the expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell GDB to not enforce strict type checking or to treat any mismatches as errors and abandon the expression; When type checking is disabled, GDB successfully evaluates expressions like the second example above.
</p>
<p>
	Even if type checking is off, there may be other reasons related to type that prevent GDB from evaluating an expression. For instance, GDB does not know how to add an int and a struct foo. These particular type errors have nothing to do with the language in use and usually arise from expressions which make little sense to evaluate anyway.
</p>
<p>
	GDB provides some additional commands for controlling type checking:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set check type on</li>
	<li>set check type off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set strict type checking on or off. If any type mismatches occur in evaluating an expression while type checking is on, GDB prints a message and aborts evaluation of the expression.
	</p>
	<li>show check type</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of type checking and whether GDB is enforcing strict type checking rules.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_5d88557f" href="#TOC_HEAD_5d88557f">15.3.2 An Overview of Range Checking</a></H3>
<p>
	In some languages (such as Modula&ndash;2), it is an error to exceed the bounds of a type; this is enforced with run&ndash;time checks. Such range checking is meant to ensure program correctness by making sure computations do not overflow, or indices on an array element access do not exceed the bounds of the array.
</p>
<p>
	For expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell GDB to treat range errors in one of three ways: ignore them, always treat them as errors and abandon the expression, or issue warnings but evaluate the expression anyway.
</p>
<p>
	A range error can result from numerical overflow, from exceeding an array index bound, or when you type a constant that is not a member of any type. Some languages, however, do not treat overflows as an error. In many implementations of C, mathematical overflow causes the result to &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; to lower values&mdash;for example, if m is the largest integer value, and s is the smallest, then
</p>
<pre><code>m + 1 ⇒ s</code></pre>
<p>
	This, too, is specific to individual languages, and in some cases specific to individual compilers or machines. See Supported Languages, for further details on specific languages.
</p>
<p>
	GDB provides some additional commands for controlling the range checker:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set check range auto</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set range checking on or off based on the current working language. See Supported Languages, for the default settings for each language.
	</p>
	<li>set check range on</li>
	<li>set check range off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set range checking on or off, overriding the default setting for the current working language. A warning is issued if the setting does not match the language default. If a range error occurs and range checking is on, then a message is printed and evaluation of the expression is aborted.
	</p>
	<li>set check range warn</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Output messages when the GDB range checker detects a range error, but attempt to evaluate the expression anyway. Evaluating the expression may still be impossible for other reasons, such as accessing memory that the process does not own (a typical example from many Unix systems).
	</p>
	<li>show check range</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of the range checker, and whether or not it is being set automatically by GDB.

<p>
	GDB supports C, C++, D, Go, Objective&ndash;C, Fortran, OpenCL C, Pascal, Rust, assembly, Modula&ndash;2, and Ada. Some GDB features may be used in expressions regardless of the language you use: the GDB @ and :: operators, and the &lsquo;{type}addr&rsquo; construct (see Expressions) can be used with the constructs of any supported language.
</p>
<p>
	The following sections detail to what degree each source language is supported by GDB. These sections are not meant to be language tutorials or references, but serve only as a reference guide to what the GDB expression parser accepts, and what input and output formats should look like for different languages. There are many good books written on each of these languages; please look to these for a language reference or tutorial.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_d141020a" href="#TOC_HEAD_d141020a">15.4.1 C and C++</a></H3>
<p>
	Since C and C++ are so closely related, many features of GDB apply to both languages. Whenever this is the case, we discuss those languages together.
</p>
<p>
	The C++ debugging facilities are jointly implemented by the C++ compiler and GDB. Therefore, to debug your C++ code effectively, you must compile your C++ programs with a supported C++ compiler, such as GNU g++, or the HP ANSI C++ compiler (aCC).
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_7f8a7c9c" href="#TOC_HEAD_7f8a7c9c">15.4.1.1 C and C++ Operators</a></H4>
<p>
	Operators must be defined on values of specific types. For instance, + is defined on numbers, but not on structures. Operators are often defined on groups of types.
</p>
<p>
	For the purposes of C and C++, the following definitions hold:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Integral types include int with any of its storage&ndash;class specifiers; char; enum; and, for C++, bool.</li>
	<li>Floating&ndash;point types include float, double, and long double (if supported by the target platform).</li>
	<li>Pointer types include all types defined as (type *).</li>
	<li>Scalar types include all of the above.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	The following operators are supported. They are listed here in order of increasing precedence:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>,</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The comma or sequencing operator. Expressions in a comma&ndash;separated list are evaluated from left to right, with the result of the entire expression being the last expression evaluated.
	</p>
	<li>=</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Assignment. The value of an assignment expression is the value assigned. Defined on scalar types.
	</p>
	<li>op=</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Used in an expression of the form a op= b, and translated to a = a op b. op= and = have the same precedence. The operator op is any one of the operators |, &circ;, &amp;, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, +, &ndash;, *, /, %.
	</p>
	<li>?:</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The ternary operator. a ? b : c can be thought of as: if a then b else c. The argument a should be of an integral type.
	</p>
	<li>||</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Logical OR. Defined on integral types.
	</p>
	<li>&amp;&amp;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Logical AND. Defined on integral types.
	</p>
	<li>|</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Bitwise OR. Defined on integral types.
	</p>
	<li>&circ;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Bitwise exclusive&ndash;OR. Defined on integral types.
	</p>
	<li>&amp;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Bitwise AND. Defined on integral types.
	</p>
	<li>==, !=</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Equality and inequality. Defined on scalar types. The value of these expressions is 0 for false and non&ndash;zero for true.
	</p>
	<li>&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Less than, greater than, less than or equal, greater than or equal. Defined on scalar types. The value of these expressions is 0 for false and non&ndash;zero for true.
	</p>
	<li>&lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		left shift, and right shift. Defined on integral types.
	</p>
	<li>@</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The GDB &ldquo;artificial array&rdquo; operator (see Expressions).
	</p>
	<li>+, &ndash;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Addition and subtraction. Defined on integral types, floating&ndash;point types and pointer types.
	</p>
	<li>*, /, %</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Multiplication, division, and modulus. Multiplication and division are defined on integral and floating&ndash;point types. Modulus is defined on integral types.
	</p>
	<li>++, &ndash;&ndash;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Increment and decrement. When appearing before a variable, the operation is performed before the variable is used in an expression; when appearing after it, the variable&rsquo;s value is used before the operation takes place.
	</p>
	<li>*</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Pointer dereferencing. Defined on pointer types. Same precedence as ++.
	</p>
	<li>&amp;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Address operator. Defined on variables. Same precedence as ++.
	</p>
	<p>
		For debugging C++, GDB implements a use of &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; beyond what is allowed in the C++ language itself: you can use &lsquo;&amp;(&amp;ref)&rsquo; to examine the address where a C++ reference variable (declared with &lsquo;&amp;ref&rsquo;) is stored.
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Negative. Defined on integral and floating&ndash;point types. Same precedence as ++.
	</p>
	<li>!</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Logical negation. Defined on integral types. Same precedence as ++.
	</p>
	<li>&tilde;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Bitwise complement operator. Defined on integral types. Same precedence as ++.
	</p>
	<li>., &ndash;&gt;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Structure member, and pointer&ndash;to&ndash;structure member. For convenience, GDB regards the two as equivalent, choosing whether to dereference a pointer based on the stored type information. Defined on struct and union data.
	</p>
	<li>.*, &ndash;&gt;*</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Dereferences of pointers to members.
	</p>
	<li>[]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Array indexing. a[i] is defined as *(a+i). Same precedence as &ndash;&gt;.
	</p>
	<li>()</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Function parameter list. Same precedence as &ndash;&gt;.
	</p>
	<li>::</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		C++ scope resolution operator. Defined on struct, union, and class types.
	</p>
	<li>::</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Doubled colons also represent the GDB scope operator (see Expressions). Same precedence as ::, above.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If an operator is redefined in the user code, GDB usually attempts to invoke the redefined version instead of using the operator&rsquo;s predefined meaning.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_fdd171d" href="#TOC_HEAD_fdd171d">15.4.1.2 C and C++ Constants</a></H4>
<p>
	GDB allows you to express the constants of C and C++ in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Integer constants are a sequence of digits. Octal constants are specified by a leading &lsquo;0&rsquo; (i.e. zero), and hexadecimal constants by a leading &lsquo;0x&rsquo; or &lsquo;0X&rsquo;. Constants may also end with a letter &lsquo;l&rsquo;, specifying that the constant should be treated as a long value.</li>
	<li>Floating point constants are a sequence of digits, followed by a decimal point, followed by a sequence of digits, and optionally followed by an exponent. An exponent is of the form: &lsquo;e[[+]|&ndash;]nnn&rsquo;, where nnn is another sequence of digits. The &lsquo;+&rsquo; is optional for positive exponents. A floating&ndash;point constant may also end with a letter &lsquo;f&rsquo; or &lsquo;F&rsquo;, specifying that the constant should be treated as being of the float (as opposed to the default double) type; or with a letter &lsquo;l&rsquo; or &lsquo;L&rsquo;, which specifies a long double constant.</li>
	<li>Enumerated constants consist of enumerated identifiers, or their integral equivalents.</li>
	<li>Character constants are a single character surrounded by single quotes (&#039;), or a number&mdash;the ordinal value of the corresponding character (usually its ASCII value). Within quotes, the single character may be represented by a letter or by escape sequences, which are of the form &lsquo;\nnn&rsquo;, where nnn is the octal representation of the character&rsquo;s ordinal value; or of the form &lsquo;\x&rsquo;, where &lsquo;x&rsquo; is a predefined special character&mdash;for example, &lsquo;\n&rsquo; for newline.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Wide character constants can be written by prefixing a character constant with &lsquo;L&rsquo;, as in C. For example, &lsquo;L&#039;x&#039;&rsquo; is the wide form of &lsquo;x&rsquo;. The target wide character set is used when computing the value of this constant (see Character Sets).
	</p>
	<li>String constants are a sequence of character constants surrounded by double quotes (&quot;). Any valid character constant (as described above) may appear. Double quotes within the string must be preceded by a backslash, so for instance &lsquo;&quot;a\&quot;b&#039;c&quot;&rsquo; is a string of five characters.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Wide string constants can be written by prefixing a string constant with &lsquo;L&rsquo;, as in C. The target wide character set is used when computing the value of this constant (see Character Sets).
	</p>
	<li>Pointer constants are an integral value. You can also write pointers to constants using the C operator &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;.</li>
	<li>Array constants are comma&ndash;separated lists surrounded by braces &lsquo;{&rsquo; and &lsquo;}&rsquo;; for example, &lsquo;{1,2,3}&rsquo; is a three&ndash;element array of integers, &lsquo;1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6&rsquo; is a three&ndash;by&ndash;two array, and &lsquo;{&amp;&quot;hi&quot;, &amp;&quot;there&quot;, &amp;&quot;fred&quot;}&rsquo; is a three&ndash;element array of pointers.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_cf6a2590" href="#TOC_HEAD_cf6a2590">15.4.1.3 C++ Expressions</a></H4>
<p>
	GDB expression handling can interpret most C++ expressions.
</p>
<pre><code>Warning: GDB can only debug C++ code if you use the proper compiler and the proper debug format. Currently, GDB works best when debugging C++ code that is compiled with the most recent version of GCC possible. The DWARF debugging format is preferred; GCC defaults to this on most popular platforms. Other compilers and/or debug formats are likely to work badly or not at all when using GDB to debug C++ code. See Compilation.</code></pre>
<ol>
	<li>Member function calls are allowed; you can use expressions like</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>count = aml-&gt;GetOriginal(x, y)	</code></pre>
	<li>While a member function is active (in the selected stack frame), your expressions have the same namespace available as the member function; that is, GDB allows implicit references to the class instance pointer this following the same rules as C++. using declarations in the current scope are also respected by GDB.</li>
	<br />
	<li>You can call overloaded functions; GDB resolves the function call to the right definition, with some restrictions. GDB does not perform overload resolution involving user&ndash;defined type conversions, calls to constructors, or instantiations of templates that do not exist in the program. It also cannot handle ellipsis argument lists or default arguments.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		It does perform integral conversions and promotions, floating&ndash;point promotions, arithmetic conversions, pointer conversions, conversions of class objects to base classes, and standard conversions such as those of functions or arrays to pointers; it requires an exact match on the number of function arguments.
	</p>
	<p>
		Overload resolution is always performed, unless you have specified set overload&ndash;resolution off. See GDB Features for C++.
	</p>
	<p>
		You must specify set overload&ndash;resolution off in order to use an explicit function signature to call an overloaded function, as in
	</p>
	<pre><code>p 'foo(char,int)'('x', 13)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The GDB command&ndash;completion facility can simplify this; see Command Completion.
	</p>
	<li>GDB understands variables declared as C++ lvalue or rvalue references; you can use them in expressions just as you do in C++ source&mdash;they are automatically dereferenced.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		In the parameter list shown when GDB displays a frame, the values of reference variables are not displayed (unlike other variables); this avoids clutter, since references are often used for large structures. The address of a reference variable is always shown, unless you have specified &lsquo;set print address off&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>GDB supports the C++ name resolution operator ::&mdash;your expressions can use it just as expressions in your program do. Since one scope may be defined in another, you can use :: repeatedly if necessary, for example in an expression like &lsquo;scope1::scope2::name&rsquo;. GDB also allows resolving name scope by reference to source files, in both C and C++ debugging (see Program Variables).</li>
	<br />
	<li>GDB performs argument&ndash;dependent lookup, following the C++ specification.</li>
	<br />
</ol>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_cdb32782" href="#TOC_HEAD_cdb32782">15.4.1.4 C and C++ Defaults</a></H4>
<p>
	If you allow GDB to set range checking automatically, it defaults to off whenever the working language changes to C or C++. This happens regardless of whether you or GDB selects the working language.
</p>
<p>
	If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, it recognizes source files whose names end with .c, .C, or .cc, etc, and when GDB enters code compiled from one of these files, it sets the working language to C or C++. See Having GDB Infer the Source Language, for further details.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_d593c98e" href="#TOC_HEAD_d593c98e">15.4.1.5 C and C++ Type and Range Checks</a></H4>
<p>
	By default, when GDB parses C or C++ expressions, strict type checking is used. However, if you turn type checking off, GDB will allow certain non&ndash;standard conversions, such as promoting integer constants to pointers.
</p>
<p>
	Range checking, if turned on, is done on mathematical operations. Array indices are not checked, since they are often used to index a pointer that is not itself an array.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_42702db4" href="#TOC_HEAD_42702db4">15.4.1.6 GDB and C</a></H4>
<p>
	The set print union and show print union commands apply to the union type. When set to &lsquo;on&rsquo;, any union that is inside a struct or class is also printed. Otherwise, it appears as &lsquo;{...}&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
	The @ operator aids in the debugging of dynamic arrays, formed with pointers and a memory allocation function. See Expressions.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_493de52e" href="#TOC_HEAD_493de52e">15.4.1.7 GDB Features for C++</a></H4>
<p>
	Some GDB commands are particularly useful with C++, and some are designed specifically for use with C++. Here is a summary:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>breakpoint menus</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When you want a breakpoint in a function whose name is overloaded, GDB has the capability to display a menu of possible breakpoint locations to help you specify which function definition you want. See Ambiguous Expressions.
	</p>
	<li>rbreak regex</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Setting breakpoints using regular expressions is helpful for setting breakpoints on overloaded functions that are not members of any special classes. See Setting Breakpoints.
	</p>
	<li>catch throw</li>
	<li>catch rethrow</li>
	<li>catch catch</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Debug C++ exception handling using these commands. See Setting Catchpoints.
	</p>
	<li>ptype typename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print inheritance relationships as well as other information for type typename. See Examining the Symbol Table.
	</p>
	<li>info vtbl expression.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The info vtbl command can be used to display the virtual method tables of the object computed by expression. This shows one entry per virtual table; there may be multiple virtual tables when multiple inheritance is in use.
	</p>
	<li>demangle name</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Demangle name. See Symbols, for a more complete description of the demangle command.
	</p>
	<li>set print demangle</li>
	<li>show print demangle</li>
	<li>set print asm&ndash;demangle</li>
	<li>show print asm&ndash;demangle</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control whether C++ symbols display in their source form, both when displaying code as C++ source and when displaying disassemblies. See Print Settings.
	</p>
	<li>set print object</li>
	<li>show print object</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Choose whether to print derived (actual) or declared types of objects. See Print Settings.
	</p>
	<li>set print vtbl</li>
	<li>show print vtbl</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the format for printing virtual function tables. See Print Settings. (The vtbl commands do not work on programs compiled with the HP ANSI C++ compiler (aCC).)
	</p>
	<li>set overload&ndash;resolution on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable overload resolution for C++ expression evaluation. The default is on. For overloaded functions, GDB evaluates the arguments and searches for a function whose signature matches the argument types, using the standard C++ conversion rules (see C++ Expressions, for details). If it cannot find a match, it emits a message.
	</p>
	<li>set overload&ndash;resolution off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable overload resolution for C++ expression evaluation. For overloaded functions that are not class member functions, GDB chooses the first function of the specified name that it finds in the symbol table, whether or not its arguments are of the correct type. For overloaded functions that are class member functions, GDB searches for a function whose signature exactly matches the argument types.
	</p>
	<li>show overload&ndash;resolution</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of overload resolution.
	</p>
	<li>Overloaded symbol names</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		You can specify a particular definition of an overloaded symbol, using the same notation that is used to declare such symbols in C++: type symbol(types) rather than just symbol. You can also use the GDB command&ndash;line word completion facilities to list the available choices, or to finish the type list for you. See Command Completion, for details on how to do this.
	</p>
	<li>Breakpoints in template functions</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Similar to how overloaded symbols are handled, GDB will ignore template parameter lists when it encounters a symbol which includes a C++ template. This permits setting breakpoints on families of template functions or functions whose parameters include template types.
	</p>
	<p>
		The &ndash;qualified flag may be used to override this behavior, causing GDB to search for a specific function or type.
	</p>
	<p>
		The GDB command&ndash;line word completion facility also understands template parameters and may be used to list available choices or finish template parameter lists for you. See Command Completion, for details on how to do this.
	</p>
	<li>Breakpoints in functions with ABI tags</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The GNU C++ compiler introduced the notion of ABI &ldquo;tags&rdquo;, which correspond to changes in the ABI of a type, function, or variable that would not otherwise be reflected in a mangled name. See https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/02/05/gcc5&ndash;and&ndash;the&ndash;c11&ndash;abi/ for more detail.
	</p>
	<p>
		The ABI tags are visible in C++ demangled names. For example, a function that returns a std::string:
	</p>
	<pre><code>std::string function(int);	</code></pre>
	<p>
		when compiled for the C++11 ABI is marked with the cxx11 ABI tag, and GDB displays the symbol like this:
	</p>
	<pre><code>function[abi:cxx11](int)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		You can set a breakpoint on such functions simply as if they had no tag. For example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) b function(int)
Breakpoint 2 at 0x40060d: file main.cc, line 10.
(gdb) info breakpoints
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address    What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x0040060d in function[abi:cxx11](int)
                                        at main.cc:10	</code></pre>
	<p>
		On the rare occasion you need to disambiguate between different ABI tags, you can do so by simply including the ABI tag in the function name, like:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) b ambiguous[abi:other_tag](int)	</code></pre>
</ul>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_ea6db109" href="#TOC_HEAD_ea6db109">15.4.1.8 Decimal Floating Point format</a></H4>
<p>
	GDB can examine, set and perform computations with numbers in decimal floating point format, which in the C language correspond to the _Decimal32, _Decimal64 and _Decimal128 types as specified by the extension to support decimal floating&ndash;point arithmetic.
</p>
<p>
	There are two encodings in use, depending on the architecture: BID (Binary Integer Decimal) for x86 and x86&ndash;64, and DPD (Densely Packed Decimal) for PowerPC and S/390. GDB will use the appropriate encoding for the configured target.
</p>
<p>
	Because of a limitation in libdecnumber, the library used by GDB to manipulate decimal floating point numbers, it is not possible to convert (using a cast, for example) integers wider than 32&ndash;bit to decimal float.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, in order to imitate GDB&rsquo;s behaviour with binary floating point computations, error checking in decimal float operations ignores underflow, overflow and divide by zero exceptions.
</p>
<p>
	In the PowerPC architecture, GDB provides a set of pseudo&ndash;registers to inspect _Decimal128 values stored in floating point registers. See PowerPC for more details.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_273536d2" href="#TOC_HEAD_273536d2">15.4.2 D</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB can be used to debug programs written in D and compiled with GDC, LDC or DMD compilers. Currently GDB supports only one D specific feature &mdash; dynamic arrays.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_bf721899" href="#TOC_HEAD_bf721899">15.4.3 Go</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB can be used to debug programs written in Go and compiled with gccgo or 6g compilers.
</p>
<p>
	Here is a summary of the Go&ndash;specific features and restrictions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The current Go package</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The name of the current package does not need to be specified when specifying global variables and functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, given the program:

</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_25cd9c79" href="#TOC_HEAD_25cd9c79">15.4.4.1 Method Names in Commands</a></H4>
<p>
	The following commands have been extended to accept Objective&ndash;C method names as line specifications:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>clear</li>
	<li>break</li>
	<li>info line</li>
	<li>jump</li>
	<li>list</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	A fully qualified Objective&ndash;C method name is specified as
</p>
<pre><code>-[Class methodName]</code></pre>
<p>
	where the minus sign is used to indicate an instance method and a plus sign (not shown) is used to indicate a class method. The class name Class and method name methodName are enclosed in brackets, similar to the way messages are specified in Objective&ndash;C source code. For example, to set a breakpoint at the create instance method of class Fruit in the program currently being debugged, enter:
</p>
<pre><code>break -[Fruit create]</code></pre>
<p>
	To list ten program lines around the initialize class method, enter:
</p>
<pre><code>list +[NSText initialize]</code></pre>
<p>
	In the current version of GDB, the plus or minus sign is required. In future versions of GDB, the plus or minus sign will be optional, but you can use it to narrow the search. It is also possible to specify just a method name:
</p>
<pre><code>break create</code></pre>
<p>
	You must specify the complete method name, including any colons. If your program&rsquo;s source files contain more than one create method, you&rsquo;ll be presented with a numbered list of classes that implement that method. Indicate your choice by number, or type &lsquo;0&rsquo; to exit if none apply.
</p>
<p>
	As another example, to clear a breakpoint established at the makeKeyAndOrderFront: method of the NSWindow class, enter:
</p>
<pre><code>clear -[NSWindow makeKeyAndOrderFront:]</code></pre>

<p>
	The print command has also been extended to accept methods. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>print -[object hash]</code></pre>
<p>
	will tell GDB to send the hash message to object and print the result. Also, an additional command has been added, print&ndash;object or po for short, which is meant to print the description of an object. However, this command may only work with certain Objective&ndash;C libraries that have a particular hook function, _NSPrintForDebugger, defined.

	<H3><a name="HEAD_9f965b66" href="#TOC_HEAD_9f965b66">15.4.6 Fortran</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB can be used to debug programs written in Fortran. Note, that not all Fortran language features are available yet.
</p>
<p>
	Some Fortran compilers (GNU Fortran 77 and Fortran 95 compilers among them) append an underscore to the names of variables and functions. When you debug programs compiled by those compilers, you will need to refer to variables and functions with a trailing underscore.
</p>
<p>
	Fortran symbols are usually case&ndash;insensitive, so GDB by default uses case&ndash;insensitive matching for Fortran symbols. You can change that with the &lsquo;set case&ndash;insensitive&rsquo; command, see Symbols, for the details.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_f4138322" href="#TOC_HEAD_f4138322">15.4.6.1 Fortran Types</a></H4>
<p>
	In Fortran the primitive data&ndash;types have an associated KIND type parameter, written as &lsquo;type*kindparam&rsquo;, &lsquo;type*kindparam&rsquo;, or in the GDB&ndash;only dialect &lsquo;type_kindparam&rsquo;. A concrete example would be &lsquo;Real*4&rsquo;, &lsquo;Real(kind=4)&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Real_4&rsquo;. The kind of a type can be retrieved by using the intrinsic function KIND, see Fortran Intrinsics.
</p>
<p>
	Generally, the actual implementation of the KIND type parameter is compiler specific. In GDB the kind parameter is implemented in accordance with its use in the GNU gfortran compiler. Here, the kind parameter for a given type specifies its size in memory &mdash; a Fortran Integer*4 or Integer(kind=4) would be an integer type occupying 4 bytes of memory. An exception to this rule is the Complex type for which the kind of the type does not specify its entire size, but the size of each of the two Real&rsquo;s it is composed of. A Complex*4 would thus consist of two Real*4s and occupy 8 bytes of memory.
</p>
<p>
	For every type there is also a default kind associated with it, e.g. Integer in GDB will internally be an Integer*4 (see the table below for default types). The default types are the same as in GNU compilers but note, that the GNU default types can actually be changed by compiler flags such as &ndash;fdefault&ndash;integer&ndash;8 and &ndash;fdefault&ndash;real&ndash;8.
</p>
<p>
	Not every kind parameter is valid for every type and in GDB the following type kinds are available.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Integer</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Integer*1, Integer*2, Integer*4, Integer*8, and Integer = Integer*4.
	</p>
	<li>Logical</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Logical*1, Logical*2, Logical*4, Logical*8, and Logical = Logical*4.
	</p>
	<li>Real</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Real*4, Real*8, Real*16, and Real = Real*4.
	</p>

		Complex*4, Complex*8, Complex*16, and Complex = Complex*4.

</p>
<ul>
	<li>**</li>

	<p>
		The exponentiation operator. It raises the first operand to the power of the second one.

	<br />
	<p>
		The access component operator. Normally used to access elements in derived types. Also suitable for unions. As unions aren&rsquo;t part of regular Fortran, this can only happen when accessing a register that uses a gdbarch&ndash;defined union type.
	</p>
	<li>::</li>

		Returns a complex number where x is converted to the real component. If y is present it is converted to the imaginary component. If y is not present then the imaginary component is set to 0.0 except if x itself is of Complex type. The optional parameter kind specifies the kind of the return type Complex(kind).
	</p>
	<li>FLOOR(a [, kind])</li>

<p>
	GDB has some commands to support Fortran&ndash;specific features, such as displaying common blocks.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info common [common&ndash;name]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command prints the values contained in the Fortran COMMON block whose name is common&ndash;name. With no argument, the names of all COMMON blocks visible at the current program location are printed.
	</p>
	<li>set fortran repack&ndash;array&ndash;slices [on|off]</li>
	<li>show fortran repack&ndash;array&ndash;slices</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When taking a slice from an array, a Fortran compiler can choose to either produce an array descriptor that describes the slice in place, or it may repack the slice, copying the elements of the slice into a new region of memory.
	</p>
	<p>
		When this setting is on, then GDB will also repack array slices in some situations. When this setting is off, then GDB will create array descriptors for slices that reference the original data in place.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB will never repack an array slice if the data for the slice is contiguous within the original array.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB will always repack string slices if the data for the slice is non&ndash;contiguous within the original string as GDB does not support printing non&ndash;contiguous strings.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default for this setting is off.

	<H3><a name="HEAD_b3dbb670" href="#TOC_HEAD_b3dbb670">15.4.8 Rust</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB supports the Rust Programming Language. Type&ndash; and value&ndash;printing, and expression parsing, are reasonably complete. However, there are a few peculiarities and holes to be aware of.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Linespecs (see Location Specifications) are never relative to the current crate. Instead, they act as if there were a global namespace of crates, somewhat similar to the way extern crate behaves.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		That is, if GDB is stopped at a breakpoint in a function in crate &lsquo;A&rsquo;, module &lsquo;B&rsquo;, then break B::f will attempt to set a breakpoint in a function named &lsquo;f&rsquo; in a crate named &lsquo;B&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a consequence of this approach, linespecs also cannot refer to items using &lsquo;self::&rsquo; or &lsquo;super::&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>Because GDB implements Rust name&ndash;lookup semantics in expressions, it will sometimes prepend the current crate to a name. For example, if GDB is stopped at a breakpoint in the crate &lsquo;K&rsquo;, then print ::x::y will try to find the symbol &lsquo;K::x::y&rsquo;.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		However, since it is useful to be able to refer to other crates when debugging, GDB provides the extern extension to circumvent this. To use the extension, just put extern before a path expression to refer to the otherwise unavailable &ldquo;global&rdquo; scope.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the above example, if you wanted to refer to the symbol &lsquo;y&rsquo; in the crate &lsquo;x&rsquo;, you would use print extern x::y.
	</p>
	<li>The Rust expression evaluator does not support &ldquo;statement&ndash;like&rdquo; expressions such as if or match, or lambda expressions.</li>
	<li>Tuple expressions are not implemented.</li>
	<li>The Rust expression evaluator does not currently implement the Drop trait. Objects that may be created by the evaluator will never be destroyed.</li>
	<li>GDB does not implement type inference for generics. In order to call generic functions or otherwise refer to generic items, you will have to specify the type parameters manually.</li>
	<li>GDB currently uses the C++ demangler for Rust. In most cases this does not cause any problems. However, in an expression context, completing a generic function name will give syntactically invalid results. This happens because Rust requires the &lsquo;::&rsquo; operator between the function name and its generic arguments. For example, GDB might provide a completion like crate::f&lt;u32&gt;, where the parser would require crate::f::&lt;u32&gt;.</li>
	<li>As of this writing, the Rust compiler (version 1.8) has a few holes in the debugging information it generates. These holes prevent certain features from being implemented by GDB:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Method calls cannot be made via traits.</li>
		<li>Operator overloading is not implemented.</li>
		<li>When debugging in a monomorphized function, you cannot use the generic type names.</li>
		<li>The type Self is not available.</li>
		<li>use statements are not available, so some names may not be available in the crate.</li>

<p>
	GDB allows you to express the constants of Modula&ndash;2 in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Integer constants are simply a sequence of digits. When used in an expression, a constant is interpreted to be type&ndash;compatible with the rest of the expression. Hexadecimal integers are specified by a trailing &lsquo;H&rsquo;, and octal integers by a trailing &lsquo;B&rsquo;.</li>
	<li>Floating point constants appear as a sequence of digits, followed by a decimal point and another sequence of digits. An optional exponent can then be specified, in the form &lsquo;E[+|&ndash;]nnn&rsquo;, where &lsquo;[+|&ndash;]nnn&rsquo; is the desired exponent. All of the digits of the floating point constant must be valid decimal (base 10) digits.</li>
	<li>Character constants consist of a single character enclosed by a pair of like quotes, either single (&#039;) or double (&quot;). They may also be expressed by their ordinal value (their ASCII value, usually) followed by a &lsquo;C&rsquo;.</li>
	<li>String constants consist of a sequence of characters enclosed by a pair of like quotes, either single (&#039;) or double (&quot;). Escape sequences in the style of C are also allowed. See C and C++ Constants, for a brief explanation of escape sequences.</li>
	<li>Enumerated constants consist of an enumerated identifier.</li>
	<li>Boolean constants consist of the identifiers TRUE and FALSE.</li>
	<li>Pointer constants consist of integral values only.</li>
	<li>Set constants are not yet supported.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_1a9044ab" href="#TOC_HEAD_1a9044ab">15.4.9.4 Modula&ndash;2 Types</a></H4>
<p>
	Currently GDB can print the following data types in Modula&ndash;2 syntax: array types, record types, set types, pointer types, procedure types, enumerated types, subrange types and base types. You can also print the contents of variables declared using these type. This section gives a number of simple source code examples together with sample GDB sessions.
</p>
<p>
	The first example contains the following section of code:
</p>
<pre><code>VAR
s: SET OF CHAR ;
r: [20..40] ;</code></pre>
<p>
	and you can request GDB to interrogate the type and value of r and s.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print s
{'A'..'C', 'Z'}
(gdb) ptype s
SET OF CHAR
(gdb) print r
21
(gdb) ptype r
[20..40]</code></pre>
<p>
	Likewise if your source code declares s as:
</p>
<pre><code>VAR
s: SET ['A'..'Z'] ;</code></pre>
<p>
	then you may query the type of s by:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) ptype s
type = SET ['A'..'Z']</code></pre>
<p>
	Note that at present you cannot interactively manipulate set expressions using the debugger.
</p>
<p>
	The following example shows how you might declare an array in Modula&ndash;2 and how you can interact with GDB to print its type and contents:
</p>
<pre><code>VAR
s: ARRAY [-10..10] OF CHAR ;

(gdb) ptype s
ARRAY [-10..10] OF CHAR</code></pre>
<p>
	Note that the array handling is not yet complete and although the type is printed correctly, expression handling still assumes that all arrays have a lower bound of zero and not &ndash;10 as in the example above.
</p>
<p>
	Here are some more type related Modula&ndash;2 examples:
</p>
<pre><code>TYPE
colour = (blue, red, yellow, green) ;
t = [blue..yellow] ;
VAR
s: t ;
BEGIN
s := blue ;</code></pre>
<p>
	The GDB interaction shows how you can query the data type and value of a variable.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print s
$1 = blue
(gdb) ptype t
type = [blue..yellow]</code></pre>
<p>
	In this example a Modula&ndash;2 array is declared and its contents displayed. Observe that the contents are written in the same way as their C counterparts.
</p>
<pre><code>VAR
s: ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL ;
BEGIN
s[1] := 1 ;

(gdb) print s
$1 = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0}
(gdb) ptype s
type = ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL</code></pre>
<p>
	The Modula&ndash;2 language interface to GDB also understands pointer types as shown in this example:
</p>
<pre><code>VAR
s: POINTER TO ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL ;
BEGIN
NEW(s) ;
s^[1] := 1 ;</code></pre>
<p>
	and you can request that GDB describes the type of s.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) ptype s
type = POINTER TO ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB handles compound types as we can see in this example. Here we combine array types, record types, pointer types and subrange types:
</p>
<pre><code>TYPE
foo = RECORD
            f1: CARDINAL ;
            f2: CHAR ;
            f3: myarray ;
        END ;

myarray = ARRAY myrange OF CARDINAL ;
myrange = [-2..2] ;
VAR
s: POINTER TO ARRAY myrange OF foo ;</code></pre>
<p>
	and you can ask GDB to describe the type of s as shown below.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) ptype s
type = POINTER TO ARRAY [-2..2] OF foo = RECORD
    f1 : CARDINAL;
    f2 : CHAR;
    f3 : ARRAY [-2..2] OF CARDINAL;
END</code></pre>

<p>
	If type and range checking are set automatically by GDB, they both default to on whenever the working language changes to Modula&ndash;2. This happens regardless of whether you or GDB selected the working language.
</p>
<p>
	If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, then entering code compiled from a file whose name ends with .mod sets the working language to Modula&ndash;2. See Having GDB Infer the Source Language, for further details.

<p>
	A few changes have been made to make Modula&ndash;2 programs easier to debug. This is done primarily via loosening its type strictness:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Unlike in standard Modula&ndash;2, pointer constants can be formed by integers. This allows you to modify pointer variables during debugging. (In standard Modula&ndash;2, the actual address contained in a pointer variable is hidden from you; it can only be modified through direct assignment to another pointer variable or expression that returned a pointer.)</li>
	<li>C escape sequences can be used in strings and characters to represent non&ndash;printable characters. GDB prints out strings with these escape sequences embedded. Single non&ndash;printable characters are printed using the &lsquo;CHR(nnn)&rsquo; format.</li>
	<li>The assignment operator (:=) returns the value of its right&ndash;hand argument.</li>
	<li>All built&ndash;in procedures both modify and return their argument.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_1d8f5c8c" href="#TOC_HEAD_1d8f5c8c">15.4.9.7 Modula&ndash;2 Type and Range Checks</a></H4>
<pre><code>Warning: in this release, GDB does not yet perform type or range checking.</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB considers two Modula&ndash;2 variables type equivalent if:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>They are of types that have been declared equivalent via a TYPE t1 = t2 statement</li>
	<li>They have been declared on the same line. (Note: This is true of the GNU Modula&ndash;2 compiler, but it may not be true of other compilers.)</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	As long as type checking is enabled, any attempt to combine variables whose types are not equivalent is an error.
</p>
<p>
	Range checking is done on all mathematical operations, assignment, array index bounds, and all built&ndash;in functions and procedures.

	<H4><a name="HEAD_e67b0c32" href="#TOC_HEAD_e67b0c32">15.4.9.8 The Scope Operators :: and .</a></H4>
<p>
	There are a few subtle differences between the Modula&ndash;2 scope operator (.) and the GDB scope operator (::). The two have similar syntax:
</p>
<pre><code>module . id
scope :: id</code></pre>
<p>
	where scope is the name of a module or a procedure, module the name of a module, and id is any declared identifier within your program, except another module.
</p>
<p>
	Using the :: operator makes GDB search the scope specified by scope for the identifier id. If it is not found in the specified scope, then GDB searches all scopes enclosing the one specified by scope.
</p>
<p>
	Using the . operator makes GDB search the current scope for the identifier specified by id that was imported from the definition module specified by module. With this operator, it is an error if the identifier id was not imported from definition module module, or if id is not an identifier in module.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_f97270f1" href="#TOC_HEAD_f97270f1">15.4.9.9 GDB and Modula&ndash;2</a></H4>
<p>
	Some GDB commands have little use when debugging Modula&ndash;2 programs. Five subcommands of set print and show print apply specifically to C and C++: &lsquo;vtbl&rsquo;, &lsquo;demangle&rsquo;, &lsquo;asm&ndash;demangle&rsquo;, &lsquo;object&rsquo;, and &lsquo;union&rsquo;. The first four apply to C++, and the last to the C union type, which has no direct analogue in Modula&ndash;2.
</p>
<p>
	The @ operator (see Expressions), while available with any language, is not useful with Modula&ndash;2. Its intent is to aid the debugging of dynamic arrays, which cannot be created in Modula&ndash;2 as they can in C or C++. However, because an address can be specified by an integral constant, the construct &lsquo;{type}adrexp&rsquo; is still useful.
</p>
<p>
	In GDB scripts, the Modula&ndash;2 inequality operator # is interpreted as the beginning of a comment. Use &lt;&gt; instead.

	<H3><a name="HEAD_a8b3c281" href="#TOC_HEAD_a8b3c281">15.4.10 Ada</a></H3>
<p>
	The extensions made to GDB for Ada only support output from the GNU Ada (GNAT) compiler. Other Ada compilers are not currently supported, and attempting to debug executables produced by them is most likely to be difficult.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_65d8d174" href="#TOC_HEAD_65d8d174">15.4.10.1 Introduction</a></H4>
<p>
	The Ada mode of GDB supports a fairly large subset of Ada expression syntax, with some extensions. The philosophy behind the design of this subset is
</p>
<ul>
	<li>That GDB should provide basic literals and access to operations for arithmetic, dereferencing, field selection, indexing, and subprogram calls, leaving more sophisticated computations to subprograms written into the program (which therefore may be called from GDB).</li>
	<li>That type safety and strict adherence to Ada language restrictions are not particularly important to the GDB user.</li>
	<li>That brevity is important to the GDB user.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	Thus, for brevity, the debugger acts as if all names declared in user&ndash;written packages are directly visible, even if they are not visible according to Ada rules, thus making it unnecessary to fully qualify most names with their packages, regardless of context. Where this causes ambiguity, GDB asks the user&rsquo;s intent.
</p>
<p>
	The debugger will start in Ada mode if it detects an Ada main program. As for other languages, it will enter Ada mode when stopped in a program that was translated from an Ada source file.
</p>
<p>
	While in Ada mode, you may use &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; for comments. This is useful mostly for documenting command files. The standard GDB comment (&lsquo;#&rsquo;) still works at the beginning of a line in Ada mode, but not in the middle (to allow based literals).
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_898fe24b" href="#TOC_HEAD_898fe24b">15.4.10.2 Omissions from Ada</a></H4>
<p>
	Here are the notable omissions from the subset:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Only a subset of the attributes are supported:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>&#039;First, &#039;Last, and &#039;Length on array objects (not on types and subtypes).</li>
		<li>&#039;Min and &#039;Max.</li>
		<li>&#039;Pos and &#039;Val.</li>
		<li>&#039;Tag.</li>
		<li>&#039;Range on array objects (not subtypes), but only as the right operand of the membership (in) operator.</li>
		<li>&#039;Access, &#039;Unchecked_Access, and &#039;Unrestricted_Access (a GNAT extension).</li>
		<li>&#039;Address.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The names in Characters.Latin_1 are not available.</li>
	<li>Equality tests (&lsquo;=&rsquo; and &lsquo;/=&rsquo;) on arrays test for bitwise equality of representations. They will generally work correctly for strings and arrays whose elements have integer or enumeration types. They may not work correctly for arrays whose element types have user&ndash;defined equality, for arrays of real values (in particular, IEEE&ndash;conformant floating point, because of negative zeroes and NaNs), and for arrays whose elements contain unused bits with indeterminate values.</li>
	<li>The other component&ndash;by&ndash;component array operations (and, or, xor, not, and relational tests other than equality) are not implemented.</li>
	<li>There is limited support for array and record aggregates. They are permitted only on the right sides of assignments, as in these examples:</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>(gdb) set An_Array := (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
(gdb) set An_Array := (1, others =&gt; 0)
(gdb) set An_Array := (0|4 =&gt; 1, 1..3 =&gt; 2, 5 =&gt; 6)
(gdb) set A_2D_Array := ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))
(gdb) set A_Record := (1, "Peter", True);
(gdb) set A_Record := (Name =&gt; "Peter", Id =&gt; 1, Alive =&gt; True)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Changing a discriminant&rsquo;s value by assigning an aggregate has an undefined effect if that discriminant is used within the record. However, you can first modify discriminants by directly assigning to them (which normally would not be allowed in Ada), and then performing an aggregate assignment. For example, given a variable A_Rec declared to have a type such as:
	</p>
	<pre><code>type Rec (Len : Small_Integer := 0) is record
    Id : Integer;
    Vals : IntArray (1 .. Len);
end record;	</code></pre>
	<p>
		you can assign a value with a different size of Vals with two assignments:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) set A_Rec.Len := 4
(gdb) set A_Rec := (Id =&gt; 42, Vals =&gt; (1, 2, 3, 4))	</code></pre>
	<p>
		As this example also illustrates, GDB is very loose about the usual rules concerning aggregates. You may leave out some of the components of an array or record aggregate (such as the Len component in the assignment to A_Rec above); they will retain their original values upon assignment. You may freely use dynamic values as indices in component associations. You may even use overlapping or redundant component associations, although which component values are assigned in such cases is not defined.
	</p>
	<li>Calls to dispatching subprograms are not implemented.</li>
	<li>The overloading algorithm is much more limited (i.e., less selective) than that of real Ada. It makes only limited use of the context in which a subexpression appears to resolve its meaning, and it is much looser in its rules for allowing type matches. As a result, some function calls will be ambiguous, and the user will be asked to choose the proper resolution.</li>
	<li>The new operator is not implemented.</li>
	<li>Entry calls are not implemented.</li>
	<li>Aside from printing, arithmetic operations on the native VAX floating&ndash;point formats are not supported.</li>
	<li>It is not possible to slice a packed array.</li>
	<li>The names True and False, when not part of a qualified name, are interpreted as if implicitly prefixed by Standard, regardless of context. Should your program redefine these names in a package or procedure (at best a dubious practice), you will have to use fully qualified names to access their new definitions.</li>
	<li>Based real literals are not implemented.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_fa3b753a" href="#TOC_HEAD_fa3b753a">15.4.10.3 Additions to Ada</a></H4>
<p>
	As it does for other languages, GDB makes certain generic extensions to Ada (see Expressions):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the expression E is a variable residing in memory (typically a local variable or array element) and N is a positive integer, then E@N displays the values of E and the N&ndash;1 adjacent variables following it in memory as an array. In Ada, this operator is generally not necessary, since its prime use is in displaying parts of an array, and slicing will usually do this in Ada. However, there are occasional uses when debugging programs in which certain debugging information has been optimized away.</li>
	<li>B::var means &ldquo;the variable named var that appears in function or file B.&rdquo; When B is a file name, you must typically surround it in single quotes.</li>
	<li><p>
	The expression {type} addr means &ldquo;the variable of type type that appears at address addr.&rdquo;
	A name starting with &lsquo;$&rsquo; is a convenience variable (see Convenience Vars) or a machine register (see Registers).
	<p></li>
</ul>
<p>
	In addition, GDB provides a few other shortcuts and outright additions specific to Ada:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The assignment statement is allowed as an expression, returning its right&ndash;hand operand as its value. Thus, you may enter</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>(gdb) set x := y + 3
(gdb) print A(tmp := y + 1)	</code></pre>
	<li>The semicolon is allowed as an &ldquo;operator,&rdquo; returning as its value the value of its right&ndash;hand operand. This allows, for example, complex conditional breaks:</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>(gdb) break f
(gdb) condition 1 (report(i); k += 1; A(k) &gt; 100)	</code></pre>
	<li>An extension to based literals can be used to specify the exact byte contents of a floating&ndash;point literal. After the base, you can use from zero to two &lsquo;l&rsquo; characters, followed by an &lsquo;f&rsquo;. The number of &lsquo;l&rsquo; characters controls the width of the resulting real constant: zero means Float is used, one means Long_Float, and two means Long_Long_Float.</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>(gdb) print 16f#41b80000#
$1 = 23.0	</code></pre>
	<li>Rather than use catenation and symbolic character names to introduce special characters into strings, one may instead use a special bracket notation, which is also used to print strings. A sequence of characters of the form &lsquo;[&quot;XX&quot;]&rsquo; within a string or character literal denotes the (single) character whose numeric encoding is XX in hexadecimal. The sequence of characters &lsquo;[&quot;&quot;&quot;]&rsquo; also denotes a single quotation mark in strings. For example,</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		&quot;One line.[&quot;0a&quot;]Next line.[&quot;0a&quot;]&quot;
	</p>
	<p>
		contains an ASCII newline character (Ada.Characters.Latin_1.LF) after each period.
	</p>
	<li>The subtype used as a prefix for the attributes &#039;Pos, &#039;Min, and &#039;Max is optional (and is ignored in any case). For example, it is valid to write</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>(gdb) print 'max(x, y)	</code></pre>
	<li>When printing arrays, GDB uses positional notation when the array has a lower bound of 1, and uses a modified named notation otherwise. For example, a one&ndash;dimensional array of three integers with a lower bound of 3 might print as</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>(3 =&gt; 10, 17, 1)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		That is, in contrast to valid Ada, only the first component has a =&gt; clause.
	</p>
	<li>You may abbreviate attributes in expressions with any unique, multi&ndash;character subsequence of their names (an exact match gets preference). For example, you may use a&#039;len, a&#039;gth, or a&#039;lh in place of a&#039;length.</li>
	<li>Since Ada is case&ndash;insensitive, the debugger normally maps identifiers you type to lower case. The GNAT compiler uses upper&ndash;case characters for some of its internal identifiers, which are normally of no interest to users. For the rare occasions when you actually have to look at them, enclose them in angle brackets to avoid the lower&ndash;case mapping. For example,</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>(gdb) print &lt;JMPBUF_SAVE&gt;[0]	</code></pre>
	<li>Printing an object of class&ndash;wide type or dereferencing an access&ndash;to&ndash;class&ndash;wide value will display all the components of the object&rsquo;s specific type (as indicated by its run&ndash;time tag). Likewise, component selection on such a value will operate on the specific type of the object.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_de49b807" href="#TOC_HEAD_de49b807">15.4.10.4 Overloading support for Ada</a></H4>
<p>
	The debugger supports limited overloading. Given a subprogram call in which the function symbol has multiple definitions, it will use the number of actual parameters and some information about their types to attempt to narrow the set of definitions. It also makes very limited use of context, preferring procedures to functions in the context of the call command, and functions to procedures elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
	If, after narrowing, the set of matching definitions still contains more than one definition, GDB will display a menu to query which one it should use, for instance:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print f(1)
Multiple matches for f
[0] cancel
[1] foo.f (integer) return boolean at foo.adb:23
[2] foo.f (foo.new_integer) return boolean at foo.adb:28
&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	In this case, just select one menu entry either to cancel expression evaluation (type 0 and press RET) or to continue evaluation with a specific instance (type the corresponding number and press RET).
</p>
<p>
	Here are a couple of commands to customize GDB&rsquo;s behavior in this case:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set ada print&ndash;signatures</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control whether parameter types and return types are displayed in overloads selection menus. It is on by default. See Overloading support for Ada.
	</p>
	<li>show ada print&ndash;signatures</li>

<p>
	Support for Ada tasks is analogous to that for threads (see Threads). GDB provides the following task&ndash;related commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info tasks</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command shows a list of current Ada tasks, as in the following example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info tasks
ID       TID P-ID Pri State                 Name
1   8088000   0   15 Child Activation Wait main_task
2   80a4000   1   15 Accept Statement      b
3   809a800   1   15 Child Activation Wait a
*  4   80ae800   3   15 Runnable              c	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In this listing, the asterisk before the last task indicates it to be the task currently being inspected.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ID</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Represents GDB&rsquo;s internal task number.
		</p>
		<li>TID</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The Ada task ID.
		</p>
		<li>P&ndash;ID</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The parent&rsquo;s task ID (GDB&rsquo;s internal task number).
		</p>
		<li>Pri</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The base priority of the task.
		</p>
		<li>State</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Current state of the task.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unactivated</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task has been created but has not been activated. It cannot be executing.
			</p>
			<li>Runnable</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is not blocked for any reason known to Ada. (It may be waiting for a mutex, though.) It is conceptually &quot;executing&quot; in normal mode.
			</p>
			<li>Terminated</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is terminated, in the sense of ARM 9.3 (5). Any dependents that were waiting on terminate alternatives have been awakened and have terminated themselves.
			</p>
			<li>Child Activation Wait</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is waiting for created tasks to complete activation.
			</p>
			<li>Accept or Select Term</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is waiting on an accept or selective wait statement.
			</p>
			<li>Waiting on entry call</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is waiting on an entry call.
			</p>
			<li>Async Select Wait</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is waiting to start the abortable part of an asynchronous select statement.
			</p>
			<li>Delay Sleep</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is waiting on a select statement with only a delay alternative open.
			</p>
			<li>Child Termination Wait</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is sleeping having completed a master within itself, and is waiting for the tasks dependent on that master to become terminated or waiting on a terminate Phase.
			</p>
			<li>Wait Child in Term Alt</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is sleeping waiting for tasks on terminate alternatives to finish terminating.
			</p>
			<li>Asynchronous Hold</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task has been held by Ada.Asynchronous_Task_Control.Hold_Task.
			</p>
			<li>Activating</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task has been created and is being made runnable.
			</p>
			<li>Selective Wait</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is waiting in a selective wait statement.
			</p>
			<li>Accepting RV with taskno</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is accepting a rendez&ndash;vous with the task taskno.
			</p>
			<li>Waiting on RV with taskno</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				The task is waiting for a rendez&ndash;vous with the task taskno.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<li>Name</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Name of the task in the program.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li>info task taskno</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command shows detailed information on the specified task, as in the following example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info tasks
ID       TID P-ID Pri State                  Name
1   8077880    0  15 Child Activation Wait  main_task
*  2   807c468    1  15 Runnable               task_1
(gdb) info task 2
Ada Task: 0x807c468
Name: "task_1"
Thread: 0
LWP: 0x1fac
Parent: 1 ("main_task")
Base Priority: 15
State: Runnable	</code></pre>
	<li>task</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command prints the ID and name of the current task.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info tasks
ID       TID P-ID Pri State                  Name
1   8077870    0  15 Child Activation Wait  main_task
*  2   807c458    1  15 Runnable               some_task
(gdb) task
[Current task is 2 "some_task"]	</code></pre>
	<li>task taskno</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command is like the thread thread&ndash;id command (see Threads). It switches the context of debugging from the current task to the given task.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info tasks
ID       TID P-ID Pri State                  Name
1   8077870    0  15 Child Activation Wait  main_task
*  2   807c458    1  15 Runnable               some_task

#4  0x804aacc in un () at un.adb:5	</code></pre>
	<li>task apply [task&ndash;id&ndash;list | all] [flag]&hellip; command</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The task apply command is the Ada tasking analogue of thread apply (see Threads). It allows you to apply the named command to one or more tasks. Specify the tasks that you want affected using a list of task IDs, or specify all to apply to all tasks.
	</p>
	<p>
		The flag arguments control what output to produce and how to handle errors raised when applying command to a task. flag must start with a &ndash; directly followed by one letter in qcs. If several flags are provided, they must be given individually, such as &ndash;c &ndash;q.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, GDB displays some task information before the output produced by command, and an error raised during the execution of a command will abort task apply. The following flags can be used to fine&ndash;tune this behavior:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&ndash;c</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The flag &ndash;c, which stands for &lsquo;continue&rsquo;, causes any errors in command to be displayed, and the execution of task apply then continues.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;s</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The flag &ndash;s, which stands for &lsquo;silent&rsquo;, causes any errors or empty output produced by a command to be silently ignored. That is, the execution continues, but the task information and errors are not printed.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash;q</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The flag &ndash;q (&lsquo;quiet&rsquo;) disables printing the task information.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Flags &ndash;c and &ndash;s cannot be used together.
	</p>
	<li>break locspec task taskno</li>
	<li>break locspec task taskno if &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These commands are like the break &hellip; thread &hellip; command (see Thread Stops). See Location Specifications, for the various forms of locspec.
	</p>
	<p>
		Use the qualifier &lsquo;task taskno&rsquo; with a breakpoint command to specify that you only want GDB to stop the program when a particular Ada task reaches this breakpoint. The taskno is one of the numeric task identifiers assigned by GDB, shown in the first column of the &lsquo;info tasks&rsquo; display.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you do not specify &lsquo;task taskno&rsquo; when you set a breakpoint, the breakpoint applies to all tasks of your program.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use the task qualifier on conditional breakpoints as well; in this case, place &lsquo;task taskno&rsquo; before the breakpoint condition (before the if).
	</p>
	<p>
		For example,
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info tasks

	<H4><a name="HEAD_e4f9b047" href="#TOC_HEAD_e4f9b047">15.4.10.8 Tasking Support when Debugging Core Files</a></H4>
<p>
	When inspecting a core file, as opposed to debugging a live program, tasking support may be limited or even unavailable, depending on the platform being used. For instance, on x86&ndash;linux, the list of tasks is available, but task switching is not supported.
</p>
<p>
	On certain platforms, the debugger needs to perform some memory writes in order to provide Ada tasking support. When inspecting a core file, this means that the core file must be opened with read&ndash;write privileges, using the command &lsquo;&quot;set write on&quot;&rsquo; (see Patching). Under these circumstances, you should make a backup copy of the core file before inspecting it with GDB.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_ce301d8f" href="#TOC_HEAD_ce301d8f">15.4.10.9 Tasking Support when using the Ravenscar Profile</a></H4>
<p>
	The Ravenscar Profile is a subset of the Ada tasking features, specifically designed for systems with safety&ndash;critical real&ndash;time requirements.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set ravenscar task&ndash;switching on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Allows task switching when debugging a program that uses the Ravenscar Profile. This is the default.
	</p>
	<li>set ravenscar task&ndash;switching off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Turn off task switching when debugging a program that uses the Ravenscar Profile. This is mostly intended to disable the code that adds support for the Ravenscar Profile, in case a bug in either GDB or in the Ravenscar runtime is preventing GDB from working properly. To be effective, this command should be run before the program is started.
	</p>
	<li>show ravenscar task&ndash;switching</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether it is possible to switch from task to task in a program using the Ravenscar Profile.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	When Ravenscar task&ndash;switching is enabled, Ravenscar tasks are announced by GDB as if they were threads:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) continue
[New Ravenscar Thread 0x2b8f0]</code></pre>
<p>
	Both Ravenscar tasks and the underlying CPU threads will show up in the output of info threads:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info threads
Id   Target Id                  Frame
1    Thread 1 (CPU#0 [running]) simple () at simple.adb:10
2    Thread 2 (CPU#1 [running]) 0x0000000000003d34 in __gnat_initialize_cpu_devices ()
3    Thread 3 (CPU#2 [running]) 0x0000000000003d28 in __gnat_initialize_cpu_devices ()
4    Thread 4 (CPU#3 [halted ]) 0x000000000000c6ec in system.task_primitives.operations.idle ()
* 5    Ravenscar Thread 0x2b8f0   simple () at simple.adb:10
6    Ravenscar Thread 0x2f150   0x000000000000c6ec in system.task_primitives.operations.idle ()</code></pre>
<p>
	One known limitation of the Ravenscar support in GDB is that it isn&rsquo;t currently possible to single&ndash;step through the runtime initialization sequence. If you need to debug this code, you should use set ravenscar task&ndash;switching off.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_981d08fe" href="#TOC_HEAD_981d08fe">15.4.10.10 Ada Source Character Set</a></H4>
<p>
	The GNAT compiler supports a number of character sets for source files. See (gnat_ugn)Character Set Control. GDB includes support for this as well.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set ada source&ndash;charset charset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the source character set for Ada. The character set must be supported by GNAT. Because this setting affects the decoding of symbols coming from the debug information in your program, the setting should be set as early as possible. The default is ISO&ndash;8859&ndash;1, because that is also GNAT&rsquo;s default.
	</p>
	<li>show ada source&ndash;charset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current source character set for Ada.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_a7c275d3" href="#TOC_HEAD_a7c275d3">15.4.10.11 Known Peculiarities of Ada Mode</a></H4>
<p>
	Besides the omissions listed previously (see Omissions from Ada), we know of several problems with and limitations of Ada mode in GDB, some of which will be fixed with planned future releases of the debugger and the GNU Ada compiler.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Static constants that the compiler chooses not to materialize as objects in storage are invisible to the debugger.</li>
	<li>Named parameter associations in function argument lists are ignored (the argument lists are treated as positional).</li>
	<li>Many useful library packages are currently invisible to the debugger.</li>
	<li>Fixed&ndash;point arithmetic, conversions, input, and output is carried out using floating&ndash;point arithmetic, and may give results that only approximate those on the host machine.</li>
	<li>The GNAT compiler never generates the prefix Standard for any of the standard symbols defined by the Ada language. GDB knows about this: it will strip the prefix from names when you use it, and will never look for a name you have so qualified among local symbols, nor match against symbols in other packages or subprograms. If you have defined entities anywhere in your program other than parameters and local variables whose simple names match names in Standard, GNAT&rsquo;s lack of qualification here can cause confusion. When this happens, you can usually resolve the confusion by qualifying the problematic names with package Standard explicitly.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	Older versions of the compiler sometimes generate erroneous debugging information, resulting in the debugger incorrectly printing the value of affected entities. In some cases, the debugger is able to work around an issue automatically. In other cases, the debugger is able to work around the issue, but the work&ndash;around has to be specifically enabled.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set ada trust&ndash;PAD&ndash;over&ndash;XVS on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Configure GDB to strictly follow the GNAT encoding when computing the value of Ada entities, particularly when PAD and PAD___XVS types are involved (see ada/exp_dbug.ads in the GCC sources for a complete description of the encoding used by the GNAT compiler). This is the default.
	</p>
	<li>set ada trust&ndash;PAD&ndash;over&ndash;XVS off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is related to the encoding using by the GNAT compiler. If GDB sometimes prints the wrong value for certain entities, changing ada trust&ndash;PAD&ndash;over&ndash;XVS to off activates a work&ndash;around which may fix the issue. It is always safe to set ada trust&ndash;PAD&ndash;over&ndash;XVS to off, but this incurs a slight performance penalty, so it is recommended to leave this setting to on unless necessary.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Internally, the debugger also relies on the compiler following a number of conventions known as the &lsquo;GNAT Encoding&rsquo;, all documented in gcc/ada/exp_dbug.ads in the GCC sources. This encoding describes how the debugging information should be generated for certain types. In particular, this convention makes use of descriptive types, which are artificial types generated purely to help the debugger.
</p>
<p>
	These encodings were defined at a time when the debugging information format used was not powerful enough to describe some of the more complex types available in Ada. Since DWARF allows us to express nearly all Ada features, the long&ndash;term goal is to slowly replace these descriptive types by their pure DWARF equivalent. To facilitate that transition, a new maintenance option is available to force the debugger to ignore those descriptive types. It allows the user to quickly evaluate how well GDB works without them.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>maintenance ada set ignore&ndash;descriptive&ndash;types [on|off]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control whether the debugger should ignore descriptive types. The default is not to ignore descriptives types (off).
	</p>
	<li>maintenance ada show ignore&ndash;descriptive&ndash;types</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show if descriptive types are ignored by GDB.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_445aa43b" href="#TOC_HEAD_445aa43b">15.5 Unsupported Languages</a></H2>
<p>
	In addition to the other fully&ndash;supported programming languages, GDB also provides a pseudo&ndash;language, called minimal. It does not represent a real programming language, but provides a set of capabilities close to what the C or assembly languages provide. This should allow most simple operations to be performed while debugging an application that uses a language currently not supported by GDB.
</p>
<p>
	If the language is set to auto, GDB will automatically select this language if the current frame corresponds to an unsupported language.
</p>
	<H1><a name="HEAD_6afa9d92" href="#TOC_HEAD_6afa9d92">16 Examining the Symbol Table</a></H1>
<p>
	The commands described in this chapter allow you to inquire about the symbols (names of variables, functions and types) defined in your program. This information is inherent in the text of your program and does not change as your program executes. GDB finds it in your program&rsquo;s symbol table, in the file indicated when you started GDB (see Choosing Files), or by one of the file&ndash;management commands (see Commands to Specify Files).
</p>
<p>
	Occasionally, you may need to refer to symbols that contain unusual characters, which GDB ordinarily treats as word delimiters. The most frequent case is in referring to static variables in other source files (see Program Variables). File names are recorded in object files as debugging symbols, but GDB would ordinarily parse a typical file name, like foo.c, as the three words &lsquo;foo&rsquo; &lsquo;.&rsquo; &lsquo;c&rsquo;. To allow GDB to recognize &lsquo;foo.c&rsquo; as a single symbol, enclose it in single quotes; for example,
</p>
<pre><code>p 'foo.c'::x</code></pre>
<p>
	looks up the value of x in the scope of the file foo.c.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set case&ndash;sensitive on</li>
	<li>set case&ndash;sensitive off</li>
	<li>set case&ndash;sensitive auto</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Normally, when GDB looks up symbols, it matches their names with case sensitivity determined by the current source language. Occasionally, you may wish to control that. The command set case&ndash;sensitive lets you do that by specifying on for case&ndash;sensitive matches or off for case&ndash;insensitive ones. If you specify auto, case sensitivity is reset to the default suitable for the source language. The default is case&ndash;sensitive matches for all languages except for Fortran, for which the default is case&ndash;insensitive matches.
	</p>
	<li>show case&ndash;sensitive</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command shows the current setting of case sensitivity for symbols lookups.
	</p>
	<li>set print type methods</li>
	<li>set print type methods on</li>
	<li>set print type methods off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Normally, when GDB prints a class, it displays any methods declared in that class. You can control this behavior either by passing the appropriate flag to ptype, or using set print type methods. Specifying on will cause GDB to display the methods; this is the default. Specifying off will cause GDB to omit the methods.
	</p>
	<li>show print type methods</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command shows the current setting of method display when printing classes.
	</p>
	<li>set print type nested&ndash;type&ndash;limit limit</li>
	<li>set print type nested&ndash;type&ndash;limit unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the limit of displayed nested types that the type printer will show. A limit of unlimited or &ndash;1 will show all nested definitions. By default, the type printer will not show any nested types defined in classes.
	</p>
	<li>show print type nested&ndash;type&ndash;limit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command shows the current display limit of nested types when printing classes.
	</p>
	<li>set print type typedefs</li>
	<li>set print type typedefs on</li>
	<li>set print type typedefs off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Normally, when GDB prints a class, it displays any typedefs defined in that class. You can control this behavior either by passing the appropriate flag to ptype, or using set print type typedefs. Specifying on will cause GDB to display the typedef definitions; this is the default. Specifying off will cause GDB to omit the typedef definitions. Note that this controls whether the typedef definition itself is printed, not whether typedef names are substituted when printing other types.
	</p>
	<li>show print type typedefs</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command shows the current setting of typedef display when printing classes.
	</p>
	<li>set print type hex</li>
	<li>set print type hex on</li>
	<li>set print type hex off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When GDB prints sizes and offsets of struct members, it can use either the decimal or hexadecimal notation. You can select one or the other either by passing the appropriate flag to ptype, or by using the set print type hex command.
	</p>
	<li>show print type hex</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command shows whether the sizes and offsets of struct members are printed in decimal or hexadecimal notation.
	</p>
	<li>info address symbol</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Describe where the data for symbol is stored. For a register variable, this says which register it is kept in. For a non&ndash;register local variable, this prints the stack&ndash;frame offset at which the variable is always stored.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note the contrast with &lsquo;print &amp;symbol&rsquo;, which does not work at all for a register variable, and for a stack local variable prints the exact address of the current instantiation of the variable.
	</p>
	<li>info symbol addr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the name of a symbol which is stored at the address addr. If no symbol is stored exactly at addr, GDB prints the nearest symbol and an offset from it:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info symbol 0x54320
_initialize_vx + 396 in section .text	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This is the opposite of the info address command. You can use it to find out the name of a variable or a function given its address.
	</p>
	<p>
		For dynamically linked executables, the name of executable or shared library containing the symbol is also printed:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info symbol 0x400225
_start + 5 in section .text of /tmp/a.out
(gdb) info symbol 0x2aaaac2811cf
__read_nocancel + 6 in section .text of /usr/lib64/libc.so.6	</code></pre>
	<li>demangle [&ndash;l language] [&ndash;&ndash;] name</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Demangle name. If language is provided it is the name of the language to demangle name in. Otherwise name is demangled in the current language.
	</p>
	<p>
		The &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; option specifies the end of options, and is useful when name begins with a dash.
	</p>
	<p>
		The parameter demangle&ndash;style specifies how to interpret the kind of mangling used. See Print Settings.
	</p>
	<li>whatis[/flags] [arg]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the data type of arg, which can be either an expression or a name of a data type. With no argument, print the data type of $, the last value in the value history.
	</p>
	<p>
		If arg is an expression (see Expressions), it is not actually evaluated, and any side&ndash;effecting operations (such as assignments or function calls) inside it do not take place.
	</p>
	<p>
		If arg is a variable or an expression, whatis prints its literal type as it is used in the source code. If the type was defined using a typedef, whatis will not print the data type underlying the typedef. If the type of the variable or the expression is a compound data type, such as struct or class, whatis never prints their fields or methods. It just prints the struct/class name (a.k.a. its tag). If you want to see the members of such a compound data type, use ptype.
	</p>
	<p>
		If arg is a type name that was defined using typedef, whatis unrolls only one level of that typedef. Unrolling means that whatis will show the underlying type used in the typedef declaration of arg. However, if that underlying type is also a typedef, whatis will not unroll it.
	</p>
	<p>
		For C code, the type names may also have the form &lsquo;class class&ndash;name&rsquo;, &lsquo;struct struct&ndash;tag&rsquo;, &lsquo;union union&ndash;tag&rsquo; or &lsquo;enum enum&ndash;tag&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		flags can be used to modify how the type is displayed. Available flags are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>r</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display in &ldquo;raw&rdquo; form. Normally, GDB substitutes template parameters and typedefs defined in a class when printing the class&rsquo; members. The /r flag disables this.
		</p>
		<li>m</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Do not print methods defined in the class.
		</p>
		<li>M</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print methods defined in the class. This is the default, but the flag exists in case you change the default with set print type methods.
		</p>
		<li>t</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Do not print typedefs defined in the class. Note that this controls whether the typedef definition itself is printed, not whether typedef names are substituted when printing other types.
		</p>
		<li>T</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print typedefs defined in the class. This is the default, but the flag exists in case you change the default with set print type typedefs.
		</p>
		<li>o</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Print the offsets and sizes of fields in a struct, similar to what the pahole tool does. This option implies the /tm flags.
		</p>
		<li>x</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Use hexadecimal notation when printing offsets and sizes of fields in a struct.
		</p>
		<li>d</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Use decimal notation when printing offsets and sizes of fields in a struct.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, given the following declarations:
		</p>
		<pre><code>struct tuv
{
int a1;
char *a2;
int a3;
};

struct xyz
{
int f1;
char f2;
void *f3;
struct tuv f4;
};

union qwe
{
struct tuv fff1;
struct xyz fff2;
};

struct tyu
{
int a1 : 1;
int a2 : 3;
int a3 : 23;
char a4 : 2;
int64_t a5;
int a6 : 5;
int64_t a7 : 3;
};		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Issuing a ptype /o struct tuv command would print:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) ptype /o struct tuv
/* offset      |    size */  type = struct tuv {
/*      0      |       4 */    int a1;
/* XXX  4-byte hole      */
/*      8      |       8 */    char *a2;
/*     16      |       4 */    int a3;

                            /* total size (bytes):   24 */
                            }		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Notice the format of the first column of comments. There, you can find two parts separated by the &lsquo;|&rsquo; character: the offset, which indicates where the field is located inside the struct, in bytes, and the size of the field. Another interesting line is the marker of a hole in the struct, indicating that it may be possible to pack the struct and make it use less space by reorganizing its fields.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is also possible to print offsets inside an union:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) ptype /o union qwe
/* offset      |    size */  type = union qwe {
/*                    24 */    struct tuv {
/*      0      |       4 */        int a1;
/* XXX  4-byte hole      */
/*      8      |       8 */        char *a2;
/*     16      |       4 */        int a3;

                                /* total size (bytes):   24 */
                            } fff1;
/*                    40 */    struct xyz {
/*      0      |       4 */        int f1;
/*      4      |       1 */        char f2;
/* XXX  3-byte hole      */
/*      8      |       8 */        void *f3;
/*     16      |      24 */        struct tuv {
/*     16      |       4 */            int a1;
/* XXX  4-byte hole      */
/*     24      |       8 */            char *a2;
/*     32      |       4 */            int a3;

                                    /* total size (bytes):   24 */
                                } f4;

                                /* total size (bytes):   40 */
                            } fff2;

                            /* total size (bytes):   40 */
                            }		</code></pre>
		<p>
			In this case, since struct tuv and struct xyz occupy the same space (because we are dealing with an union), the offset is not printed for them. However, you can still examine the offset of each of these structures&rsquo; fields.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another useful scenario is printing the offsets of a struct containing bitfields:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) ptype /o struct tyu
/* offset      |    size */  type = struct tyu {
/*      0:31   |       4 */    int a1 : 1;
/*      0:28   |       4 */    int a2 : 3;
/*      0: 5   |       4 */    int a3 : 23;
/*      3: 3   |       1 */    signed char a4 : 2;
/* XXX  3-bit hole       */
/* XXX  4-byte hole      */
/*      8      |       8 */    int64_t a5;
/*     16: 0   |       4 */    int a6 : 5;
/*     16: 5   |       8 */    int64_t a7 : 3;
/* XXX  7-byte padding   */

                            /* total size (bytes):   24 */
                            }		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Note how the offset information is now extended to also include the first bit of the bitfield.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li>ptype[/flags] [arg]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		ptype accepts the same arguments as whatis, but prints a detailed description of the type, instead of just the name of the type. See Expressions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Contrary to whatis, ptype always unrolls any typedefs in its argument declaration, whether the argument is a variable, expression, or a data type. This means that ptype of a variable or an expression will not print literally its type as present in the source code&mdash;use whatis for that. typedefs at the pointer or reference targets are also unrolled. Only typedefs of fields, methods and inner class typedefs of structs, classes and unions are not unrolled even with ptype.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, for this variable declaration:
	</p>
	<pre><code>typedef double real_t;
struct complex { real_t real; double imag; };
typedef struct complex complex_t;
complex_t var;
real_t *real_pointer_var;	</code></pre>
	<p>
		the two commands give this output:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) whatis var
type = complex_t
(gdb) ptype var
type = struct complex {
    real_t real;
    double imag;
}
(gdb) whatis complex_t
type = struct complex
(gdb) whatis struct complex
type = struct complex
(gdb) ptype struct complex
type = struct complex {
    real_t real;
    double imag;
}
(gdb) whatis real_pointer_var
type = real_t *
(gdb) ptype real_pointer_var
type = double *	</code></pre>
	<p>
		As with whatis, using ptype without an argument refers to the type of $, the last value in the value history.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sometimes, programs use opaque data types or incomplete specifications of complex data structure. If the debug information included in the program does not allow GDB to display a full declaration of the data type, it will say &lsquo;&lt;incomplete type&gt;&rsquo;. For example, given these declarations:
	</p>
	<pre><code>struct foo;
struct foo *fooptr;	</code></pre>
	<p>
		but no definition for struct foo itself, GDB will say:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) ptype foo
$1 = &lt;incomplete type&gt;	</code></pre>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Incomplete type&rdquo; is C terminology for data types that are not completely specified.
	</p>
	<p>
		Othertimes, information about a variable&rsquo;s type is completely absent from the debug information included in the program. This most often happens when the program or library where the variable is defined includes no debug information at all. GDB knows the variable exists from inspecting the linker/loader symbol table (e.g., the ELF dynamic symbol table), but such symbols do not contain type information. Inspecting the type of a (global) variable for which GDB has no type information shows:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) ptype var
type = &lt;data variable, no debug info&gt;	</code></pre>
	<p>
		See no debug info variables, for how to print the values of such variables.
	</p>
	<li>info types [&ndash;q] [regexp]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print a brief description of all types whose names match the regular expression regexp (or all types in your program, if you supply no argument). Each complete typename is matched as though it were a complete line; thus, &lsquo;i type value&rsquo; gives information on all types in your program whose names include the string value, but &lsquo;i type &circ;value$&rsquo; gives information only on types whose complete name is value.
	</p>
	<p>
		In programs using different languages, GDB chooses the syntax to print the type description according to the &lsquo;set language&rsquo; value: using &lsquo;set language auto&rsquo; (see Set Language Automatically) means to use the language of the type, other values mean to use the manually specified language (see Set Language Manually).
	</p>
	<p>
		This command differs from ptype in two ways: first, like whatis, it does not print a detailed description; second, it lists all source files and line numbers where a type is defined.
	</p>
	<p>
		The output from &lsquo;into types&rsquo; is proceeded with a header line describing what types are being listed. The optional flag &lsquo;&ndash;q&rsquo;, which stands for &lsquo;quiet&rsquo;, disables printing this header information.
	</p>
	<li>info type&ndash;printers</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Versions of GDB that ship with Python scripting enabled may have &ldquo;type printers&rdquo; available. When using ptype or whatis, these printers are consulted when the name of a type is needed. See Type Printing API, for more information on writing type printers.
	</p>
	<p>
		info type&ndash;printers displays all the available type printers.
	</p>
	<li>enable type&ndash;printer name&hellip;</li>
	<li>disable type&ndash;printer name&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These commands can be used to enable or disable type printers.
	</p>
	<li>info scope locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		List all the variables local to the lexical scope of the code location that results from resolving locspec. See Location Specifications, for details about supported forms of locspec. For example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info scope command_line_handler
Scope for command_line_handler:
Symbol rl is an argument at stack/frame offset 8, length 4.
Symbol linebuffer is in static storage at address 0x150a18, length 4.
Symbol linelength is in static storage at address 0x150a1c, length 4.
Symbol p is a local variable in register $esi, length 4.
Symbol p1 is a local variable in register $ebx, length 4.
Symbol nline is a local variable in register $edx, length 4.
Symbol repeat is a local variable at frame offset -8, length 4.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This command is especially useful for determining what data to collect during a trace experiment, see collect.
	</p>
	<li>info source</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show information about the current source file&mdash;that is, the source file for the function containing the current point of execution:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the name of the source file, and the directory containing it,</li>
		<li>the directory it was compiled in,</li>
		<li>its length, in lines,</li>
		<li>which programming language it is written in,</li>
		<li>if the debug information provides it, the program that compiled the file (which may include, e.g., the compiler version and command line arguments),</li>
		<li>whether the executable includes debugging information for that file, and if so, what format the information is in (e.g., STABS, Dwarf 2, etc.), and</li>
		<li>whether the debugging information includes information about preprocessor macros.</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<li>info sources [&ndash;dirname | &ndash;basename] [&ndash;&ndash;] [regexp]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		With no options &lsquo;info sources&rsquo; prints the names of all source files in your program for which there is debugging information. The source files are presented based on a list of object files (executables and libraries) currently loaded into GDB. For each object file all of the associated source files are listed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each source file will only be printed once for each object file, but a single source file can be repeated in the output if it is part of multiple object files.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the optional regexp is provided, then only source files that match the regular expression will be printed. The matching is case&ndash;sensitive, except on operating systems that have case&ndash;insensitive filesystem (e.g., MS&ndash;Windows). &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; can be used before regexp to prevent GDB interpreting regexp as a command option (e.g. if regexp starts with &lsquo;&ndash;&rsquo;).
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, the regexp is used to match anywhere in the filename. If &ndash;dirname, only files having a dirname matching regexp are shown. If &ndash;basename, only files having a basename matching regexp are shown.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is possible that an object file may be printed in the list with no associated source files. This can happen when either no source files match regexp, or, the object file was compiled without debug information and so GDB is unable to find any source file names.
	</p>
	<li>info functions [&ndash;q] [&ndash;n]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the names and data types of all defined functions. Similarly to &lsquo;info types&rsquo;, this command groups its output by source files and annotates each function definition with its source line number.
	</p>
	<p>
		In programs using different languages, GDB chooses the syntax to print the function name and type according to the &lsquo;set language&rsquo; value: using &lsquo;set language auto&rsquo; (see Set Language Automatically) means to use the language of the function, other values mean to use the manually specified language (see Set Language Manually).
	</p>
	<p>
		The &lsquo;&ndash;n&rsquo; flag excludes non&ndash;debugging symbols from the results. A non&ndash;debugging symbol is a symbol that comes from the executable&rsquo;s symbol table, not from the debug information (for example, DWARF) associated with the executable.
	</p>
	<p>
		The optional flag &lsquo;&ndash;q&rsquo;, which stands for &lsquo;quiet&rsquo;, disables printing header information and messages explaining why no functions have been printed.
	</p>
	<li>info functions [&ndash;q] [&ndash;n] [&ndash;t type_regexp] [regexp]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like &lsquo;info functions&rsquo;, but only print the names and data types of the functions selected with the provided regexp(s).
	</p>
	<p>
		If regexp is provided, print only the functions whose names match the regular expression regexp. Thus, &lsquo;info fun step&rsquo; finds all functions whose names include step; &lsquo;info fun &circ;step&rsquo; finds those whose names start with step. If a function name contains characters that conflict with the regular expression language (e.g. &lsquo;operator*()&rsquo;), they may be quoted with a backslash.
	</p>
	<p>
		If type_regexp is provided, print only the functions whose types, as printed by the whatis command, match the regular expression type_regexp. If type_regexp contains space(s), it should be enclosed in quote characters. If needed, use backslash to escape the meaning of special characters or quotes. Thus, &lsquo;info fun &ndash;t &#039;&circ;int (&#039;&rsquo; finds the functions that return an integer; &lsquo;info fun &ndash;t &#039;(.*int.*&#039;&rsquo; finds the functions that have an argument type containing int; &lsquo;info fun &ndash;t &#039;&circ;int (&#039; &circ;step&rsquo; finds the functions whose names start with step and that return int.
	</p>
	<p>
		If both regexp and type_regexp are provided, a function is printed only if its name matches regexp and its type matches type_regexp.
	</p>
	<li>info variables [&ndash;q] [&ndash;n]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the names and data types of all variables that are defined outside of functions (i.e. excluding local variables). The printed variables are grouped by source files and annotated with their respective source line numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		In programs using different languages, GDB chooses the syntax to print the variable name and type according to the &lsquo;set language&rsquo; value: using &lsquo;set language auto&rsquo; (see Set Language Automatically) means to use the language of the variable, other values mean to use the manually specified language (see Set Language Manually).
	</p>
	<p>
		The &lsquo;&ndash;n&rsquo; flag excludes non&ndash;debugging symbols from the results.
	</p>
	<p>
		The optional flag &lsquo;&ndash;q&rsquo;, which stands for &lsquo;quiet&rsquo;, disables printing header information and messages explaining why no variables have been printed.
	</p>
	<li>info variables [&ndash;q] [&ndash;n] [&ndash;t type_regexp] [regexp]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like info variables, but only print the variables selected with the provided regexp(s).
	</p>
	<p>
		If regexp is provided, print only the variables whose names match the regular expression regexp.
	</p>
	<p>
		If type_regexp is provided, print only the variables whose types, as printed by the whatis command, match the regular expression type_regexp. If type_regexp contains space(s), it should be enclosed in quote characters. If needed, use backslash to escape the meaning of special characters or quotes.
	</p>
	<p>
		If both regexp and type_regexp are provided, an argument is printed only if its name matches regexp and its type matches type_regexp.
	</p>
	<li>info modules [&ndash;q] [regexp]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		List all Fortran modules in the program, or all modules matching the optional regular expression regexp.
	</p>
	<p>
		The optional flag &lsquo;&ndash;q&rsquo;, which stands for &lsquo;quiet&rsquo;, disables printing header information and messages explaining why no modules have been printed.
	</p>
	<li>info module functions [&ndash;q] [&ndash;m module&ndash;regexp] [&ndash;t type&ndash;regexp] [regexp]</li>
	<li>info module variables [&ndash;q] [&ndash;m module&ndash;regexp] [&ndash;t type&ndash;regexp] [regexp]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		List all functions or variables within all Fortran modules. The set of functions or variables listed can be limited by providing some or all of the optional regular expressions. If module&ndash;regexp is provided, then only Fortran modules matching module&ndash;regexp will be searched. Only functions or variables whose type matches the optional regular expression type&ndash;regexp will be listed. And only functions or variables whose name matches the optional regular expression regexp will be listed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The optional flag &lsquo;&ndash;q&rsquo;, which stands for &lsquo;quiet&rsquo;, disables printing header information and messages explaining why no functions or variables have been printed.
	</p>
	<li>info main</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the name of the starting function of the program. This serves primarily Fortran programs, which have a user&ndash;supplied name for the main subroutine.
	</p>
	<li>info classes</li>
	<li>info classes regexp</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display all Objective&ndash;C classes in your program, or (with the regexp argument) all those matching a particular regular expression.
	</p>
	<li>info selectors</li>
	<li>info selectors regexp</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display all Objective&ndash;C selectors in your program, or (with the regexp argument) all those matching a particular regular expression.
	</p>
	<li>set opaque&ndash;type&ndash;resolution on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB to resolve opaque types. An opaque type is a type declared as a pointer to a struct, class, or union&mdash;for example, struct MyType *&mdash;that is used in one source file although the full declaration of struct MyType is in another source file. The default is on.
	</p>
	<p>
		A change in the setting of this subcommand will not take effect until the next time symbols for a file are loaded.
	</p>
	<li>set opaque&ndash;type&ndash;resolution off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB not to resolve opaque types. In this case, the type is printed as follows:
	</p>
	<p>
		{&lt;no data fields&gt;}
	</p>
	<li>show opaque&ndash;type&ndash;resolution</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether opaque types are resolved or not.
	</p>
	<li>set print symbol&ndash;loading</li>
	<li>set print symbol&ndash;loading full</li>
	<li>set print symbol&ndash;loading brief</li>
	<li>set print symbol&ndash;loading off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The set print symbol&ndash;loading command allows you to control the printing of messages when GDB loads symbol information. By default a message is printed for the executable and one for each shared library, and normally this is what you want. However, when debugging apps with large numbers of shared libraries these messages can be annoying. When set to brief a message is printed for each executable, and when GDB loads a collection of shared libraries at once it will only print one message regardless of the number of shared libraries. When set to off no messages are printed.
	</p>
	<li>show print symbol&ndash;loading</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether messages will be printed when a GDB command entered from the keyboard causes symbol information to be loaded.
	</p>
	<li>maint print symbols [&ndash;pc address] [filename]</li>
	<li>maint print symbols [&ndash;objfile objfile] [&ndash;source source] [&ndash;&ndash;] [filename]</li>
	<li>maint print psymbols [&ndash;objfile objfile] [&ndash;pc address] [&ndash;&ndash;] [filename]</li>
	<li>maint print psymbols [&ndash;objfile objfile] [&ndash;source source] [&ndash;&ndash;] [filename]</li>
	<li>maint print msymbols [&ndash;objfile objfile] [&ndash;&ndash;] [filename]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Write a dump of debugging symbol data into the file filename or the terminal if filename is unspecified. If &ndash;objfile objfile is specified, only dump symbols for that objfile. If &ndash;pc address is specified, only dump symbols for the file with code at that address. Note that address may be a symbol like main. If &ndash;source source is specified, only dump symbols for that source file.
	</p>
	<p>
		These commands are used to debug the GDB symbol&ndash;reading code. These commands do not modify internal GDB state, therefore &lsquo;maint print symbols&rsquo; will only print symbols for already expanded symbol tables. You can use the command info sources to find out which files these are. If you use &lsquo;maint print psymbols&rsquo; instead, the dump shows information about symbols that GDB only knows partially&mdash;that is, symbols defined in files that GDB has skimmed, but not yet read completely. Finally, &lsquo;maint print msymbols&rsquo; just dumps &ldquo;minimal symbols&rdquo;, e.g., &ldquo;ELF symbols&rdquo;.
	</p>
	<p>

	<H1><a name="HEAD_db29883e" href="#TOC_HEAD_db29883e">17 Altering Execution</a></H1>
<p>
	Once you think you have found an error in your program, you might want to find out for certain whether correcting the apparent error would lead to correct results in the rest of the run. You can find the answer by experiment, using the GDB features for altering execution of the program.
</p>
<p>
	For example, you can store new values into variables or memory locations, give your program a signal, restart it at a different address, or even return prematurely from a function.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_d34f138e" href="#TOC_HEAD_d34f138e">17.1 Assignment to Variables</a></H2>
<p>
	To alter the value of a variable, evaluate an assignment expression. See Expressions. For example,
</p>
<pre><code>print x=4</code></pre>
<p>
	stores the value 4 into the variable x, and then prints the value of the assignment expression (which is 4). See Using GDB with Different Languages, for more information on operators in supported languages.
</p>
<p>
	If you are not interested in seeing the value of the assignment, use the set command instead of the print command. set is really the same as print except that the expression&rsquo;s value is not printed and is not put in the value history (see Value History). The expression is evaluated only for its effects.
</p>
<p>
	If the beginning of the argument string of the set command appears identical to a set subcommand, use the set variable command instead of just set. This command is identical to set except for its lack of subcommands. For example, if your program has a variable width, you get an error if you try to set a new value with just &lsquo;set width=13&rsquo;, because GDB has the command set width:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) whatis width
type = double
(gdb) p width
$4 = 13
(gdb) set width=47
Invalid syntax in expression.</code></pre>
<p>
	The invalid expression, of course, is &lsquo;=47&rsquo;. In order to actually set the program&rsquo;s variable width, use
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set var width=47</code></pre>
<p>
	Because the set command has many subcommands that can conflict with the names of program variables, it is a good idea to use the set variable command instead of just set. For example, if your program has a variable g, you run into problems if you try to set a new value with just &lsquo;set g=4&rsquo;, because GDB has the command set gnutarget, abbreviated set g:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) whatis g
type = double
(gdb) p g
$1 = 1
(gdb) set g=4
(gdb) p g
$2 = 1
(gdb) r
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /home/smith/cc_progs/a.out
"/home/smith/cc_progs/a.out": can't open to read symbols:
                                Invalid bfd target.
(gdb) show g
The current BFD target is "=4".</code></pre>
<p>
	The program variable g did not change, and you silently set the gnutarget to an invalid value. In order to set the variable g, use
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set var g=4</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB allows more implicit conversions in assignments than C; you can freely store an integer value into a pointer variable or vice versa, and you can convert any structure to any other structure that is the same length or shorter.
</p>
<p>
	To store values into arbitrary places in memory, use the &lsquo;{&hellip;}&rsquo; construct to generate a value of specified type at a specified address (see Expressions). For example, {int}0x83040 refers to memory location 0x83040 as an integer (which implies a certain size and representation in memory), and
</p>
<pre><code>set {int}0x83040 = 4</code></pre>
<p>
	stores the value 4 into that memory location.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_fbd5bd07" href="#TOC_HEAD_fbd5bd07">17.2 Continuing at a Different Address</a></H2>
<p>
	Ordinarily, when you continue your program, you do so at the place where it stopped, with the continue command. You can instead continue at an address of your own choosing, with the following commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>jump locspec</li>
	<li>j locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Resume execution at the address of the code location that results from resolving locspec. See Location Specifications, for a description of the different forms of locspec. If locspec resolves to more than one address, those outside the current compilation unit are ignored. If considering just the addresses in the current compilation unit still doesn&rsquo;t yield a unique address, the command aborts before jumping. Execution stops again immediately if there is a breakpoint there. It is common practice to use the tbreak command in conjunction with jump. See Setting Breakpoints.
	</p>
	<p>
		The jump command does not change the current stack frame, or the stack pointer, or the contents of any memory location or any register other than the program counter. If locspec resolves to an address in a different function from the one currently executing, the results may be bizarre if the two functions expect different patterns of arguments or of local variables. For this reason, the jump command requests confirmation if the jump address is not in the function currently executing. However, even bizarre results are predictable if you are well acquainted with the machine&ndash;language code of your program.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	On many systems, you can get much the same effect as the jump command by storing a new value into the register $pc. The difference is that this does not start your program running; it only changes the address of where it will run when you continue. For example,
</p>
<pre><code>set $pc = 0x485</code></pre>
<p>
	makes the next continue command or stepping command execute at address 0x485, rather than at the address where your program stopped. See Continuing and Stepping.
</p>
<p>
	However, writing directly to $pc will only change the value of the program&ndash;counter register, while using jump will ensure that any additional auxiliary state is also updated. For example, on SPARC, jump will update both $pc and $npc registers prior to resuming execution. When using the approach of writing directly to $pc it is your job to also update the $npc register.
</p>
<p>
	The most common occasion to use the jump command is to back up&mdash;perhaps with more breakpoints set&mdash;over a portion of a program that has already executed, in order to examine its execution in more detail.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_106b9c93" href="#TOC_HEAD_106b9c93">17.3 Giving your Program a Signal</a></H2>
<ul>
	<li>signal signal</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Resume execution where your program is stopped, but immediately give it the signal signal. The signal can be the name or the number of a signal. For example, on many systems signal 2 and signal SIGINT are both ways of sending an interrupt signal.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alternatively, if signal is zero, continue execution without giving a signal. This is useful when your program stopped on account of a signal and would ordinarily see the signal when resumed with the continue command; &lsquo;signal 0&rsquo; causes it to resume without a signal.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: When resuming a multi&ndash;threaded program, signal is delivered to the currently selected thread, not the thread that last reported a stop. This includes the situation where a thread was stopped due to a signal. So if you want to continue execution suppressing the signal that stopped a thread, you should select that same thread before issuing the &lsquo;signal 0&rsquo; command. If you issue the &lsquo;signal 0&rsquo; command with another thread as the selected one, GDB detects that and asks for confirmation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Invoking the signal command is not the same as invoking the kill utility from the shell. Sending a signal with kill causes GDB to decide what to do with the signal depending on the signal handling tables (see Signals). The signal command passes the signal directly to your program.
	</p>
	<p>
		signal does not repeat when you press RET a second time after executing the command.
	</p>
	<li>queue&ndash;signal signal</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Queue signal to be delivered immediately to the current thread when execution of the thread resumes. The signal can be the name or the number of a signal. For example, on many systems signal 2 and signal SIGINT are both ways of sending an interrupt signal. The handling of the signal must be set to pass the signal to the program, otherwise GDB will report an error. You can control the handling of signals from GDB with the handle command (see Signals).
	</p>
	<p>
		Alternatively, if signal is zero, any currently queued signal for the current thread is discarded and when execution resumes no signal will be delivered. This is useful when your program stopped on account of a signal and would ordinarily see the signal when resumed with the continue command.
	</p>
	<p>
		This command differs from the signal command in that the signal is just queued, execution is not resumed. And queue&ndash;signal cannot be used to pass a signal whose handling state has been set to nopass (see Signals).
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	See stepping into signal handlers, for information on how stepping commands behave when the thread has a signal queued.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_bea7dacb" href="#TOC_HEAD_bea7dacb">17.4 Returning from a Function</a></H2>
<ul>
	<li>return</li>
	<li>return expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		You can cancel execution of a function call with the return command. If you give an expression argument, its value is used as the function&rsquo;s return value.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	When you use return, GDB discards the selected stack frame (and all frames within it). You can think of this as making the discarded frame return prematurely. If you wish to specify a value to be returned, give that value as the argument to return.
</p>
<p>
	This pops the selected stack frame (see Selecting a Frame), and any other frames inside of it, leaving its caller as the innermost remaining frame. That frame becomes selected. The specified value is stored in the registers used for returning values of functions.
</p>
<p>
	The return command does not resume execution; it leaves the program stopped in the state that would exist if the function had just returned. In contrast, the finish command (see Continuing and Stepping) resumes execution until the selected stack frame returns naturally.
</p>
<p>
	GDB needs to know how the expression argument should be set for the inferior. The concrete registers assignment depends on the OS ABI and the type being returned by the selected stack frame. For example it is common for OS ABI to return floating point values in FPU registers while integer values in CPU registers. Still some ABIs return even floating point values in CPU registers. Larger integer widths (such as long long int) also have specific placement rules. GDB already knows the OS ABI from its current target so it needs to find out also the type being returned to make the assignment into the right register(s).
</p>
<p>
	Normally, the selected stack frame has debug info. GDB will always use the debug info instead of the implicit type of expression when the debug info is available. For example, if you type return &ndash;1, and the function in the current stack frame is declared to return a long long int, GDB transparently converts the implicit int value of &ndash;1 into a long long int:
</p>
<pre><code>Breakpoint 1, func () at gdb.base/return-nodebug.c:29
29        return 31;
(gdb) return -1
Make func return now? (y or n) y
#0  0x004004f6 in main () at gdb.base/return-nodebug.c:43
43        printf ("result=%lld\n", func ());
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	However, if the selected stack frame does not have a debug info, e.g., if the function was compiled without debug info, GDB has to find out the type to return from user. Specifying a different type by mistake may set the value in different inferior registers than the caller code expects. For example, typing return &ndash;1 with its implicit type int would set only a part of a long long int result for a debug info less function (on 32&ndash;bit architectures). Therefore the user is required to specify the return type by an appropriate cast explicitly:
</p>
<pre><code>Breakpoint 2, 0x0040050b in func ()
(gdb) return -1
Return value type not available for selected stack frame.
Please use an explicit cast of the value to return.
(gdb) return (long long int) -1
Make selected stack frame return now? (y or n) y
#0  0x00400526 in main ()

<ul>
	<li>print expr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Evaluate the expression expr and display the resulting value. The expression may include calls to functions in the program being debugged.

	<li>call expr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Evaluate the expression expr without displaying void returned values.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use this variant of the print command if you want to execute a function from your program that does not return anything (a.k.a. a void function), but without cluttering the output with void returned values that GDB will otherwise print. If the result is not void, it is printed and saved in the value history.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	It is possible for the function you call via the print or call command to generate a signal (e.g., if there&rsquo;s a bug in the function, or if you passed it incorrect arguments). What happens in that case is controlled by the set unwindonsignal command.
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, with a C++ program it is possible for the function you call via the print or call command to generate an exception that is not handled due to the constraints of the dummy frame. In this case, any exception that is raised in the frame, but has an out&ndash;of&ndash;frame exception handler will not be found. GDB builds a dummy&ndash;frame for the inferior function call, and the unwinder cannot seek for exception handlers outside of this dummy&ndash;frame. What happens in that case is controlled by the set unwind&ndash;on&ndash;terminating&ndash;exception command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set unwindonsignal</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set unwinding of the stack if a signal is received while in a function that GDB called in the program being debugged. If set to on, GDB unwinds the stack it created for the call and restores the context to what it was before the call. If set to off (the default), GDB stops in the frame where the signal was received.
	</p>
	<li>show unwindonsignal</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of stack unwinding in the functions called by GDB.
	</p>
	<li>set unwind&ndash;on&ndash;terminating&ndash;exception</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set unwinding of the stack if a C++ exception is raised, but left unhandled while in a function that GDB called in the program being debugged. If set to on (the default), GDB unwinds the stack it created for the call and restores the context to what it was before the call. If set to off, GDB the exception is delivered to the default C++ exception handler and the inferior terminated.
	</p>
	<li>show unwind&ndash;on&ndash;terminating&ndash;exception</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of stack unwinding in the functions called by GDB.
	</p>
	<li>set may&ndash;call&ndash;functions</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set permission to call functions in the program. This controls whether GDB will attempt to call functions in the program, such as with expressions in the print command. It defaults to on.
	</p>
	<p>
		To call a function in the program, GDB has to temporarily modify the state of the inferior. This has potentially undesired side effects. Also, having GDB call nested functions is likely to be erroneous and may even crash the program being debugged. You can avoid such hazards by forbidding GDB from calling functions in the program being debugged. If calling functions in the program is forbidden, GDB will throw an error when a command (such as printing an expression) starts a function call in the program.
	</p>
	<li>show may&ndash;call&ndash;functions</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show permission to call functions in the program.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	When calling a function within a program, it is possible that the program could enter a state from which the called function may never return. If this happens then it is possible to interrupt the function call by typing the interrupt character (often Ctrl&ndash;c).
</p>
<p>
	If a called function is interrupted for any reason, including hitting a breakpoint, or triggering a watchpoint, and the stack is not unwound due to set unwind&ndash;on&ndash;terminating&ndash;exception on or set unwindonsignal on (see stack unwind settings), then the dummy&ndash;frame, created by GDB to facilitate the call to the program function, will be visible in the backtrace, for example frame #3 in the following backtrace:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) backtrace
#0  0x00007ffff7b3d1e7 in nanosleep () from /lib64/libc.so.6
#1  0x00007ffff7b3d11e in sleep () from /lib64/libc.so.6
#2  0x000000000040113f in deadlock () at test.cc:13
#3  &lt;function called from gdb&gt;
#4  breakpt () at test.cc:20
#5  0x0000000000401151 in main () at test.cc:25</code></pre>
<p>
	At this point it is possible to examine the state of the inferior just like any other stop.
</p>
<p>
	Depending on why the function was interrupted then it may be possible to resume the inferior (using commands like continue, step, etc). In this case, when the inferior finally returns to the dummy&ndash;frame, GDB will once again halt the inferior.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_1be7a011" href="#TOC_HEAD_1be7a011">17.5.1 Calling functions with no debug info</a></H3>
<p>
	Sometimes, a function you wish to call is missing debug information. In such case, GDB does not know the type of the function, including the types of the function&rsquo;s parameters. To avoid calling the inferior function incorrectly, which could result in the called function functioning erroneously and even crash, GDB refuses to call the function unless you tell it the type of the function.
</p>
<p>
	For prototyped (i.e. ANSI/ISO style) functions, there are two ways to do that. The simplest is to cast the call to the function&rsquo;s declared return type. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p getenv ("PATH")
'getenv' has unknown return type; cast the call to its declared return type
(gdb) p (char *) getenv ("PATH")
$1 = 0x7fffffffe7ba "/usr/local/bin:/"...</code></pre>
<p>
	Casting the return type of a no&ndash;debug function is equivalent to casting the function to a pointer to a prototyped function that has a prototype that matches the types of the passed&ndash;in arguments, and calling that. I.e., the call above is equivalent to:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p ((char * (*) (const char *)) getenv) ("PATH")</code></pre>
<p>
	and given this prototyped C or C++ function with float parameters:
</p>
<pre><code>float multiply (float v1, float v2) { return v1 * v2; }</code></pre>
<p>
	these calls are equivalent:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p (float) multiply (2.0f, 3.0f)

<p>
	If the function you wish to call is declared as unprototyped (i.e. old K&amp;R style), you must use the cast&ndash;to&ndash;function&ndash;pointer syntax, so that GDB knows that it needs to apply default argument promotions (promote float arguments to double). See float promotion. For example, given this unprototyped C function with float parameters, and no debug info:
</p>
<pre><code>float
multiply_noproto (v1, v2)
float v1, v2;
{
return v1 * v2;
}</code></pre>
<p>
	you call it like this:

<p>
	By default, GDB opens the file containing your program&rsquo;s executable code (or the corefile) read&ndash;only. This prevents accidental alterations to machine code; but it also prevents you from intentionally patching your program&rsquo;s binary.
</p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;d like to be able to patch the binary, you can specify that explicitly with the set write command. For example, you might want to turn on internal debugging flags, or even to make emergency repairs.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set write on</li>
	<li>set write off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If you specify &lsquo;set write on&rsquo;, GDB opens executable and core files for both reading and writing; if you specify set write off (the default), GDB opens them read&ndash;only.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have already loaded a file, you must load it again (using the exec&ndash;file or core&ndash;file command) after changing set write, for your new setting to take effect.

</div>
<p>
	GDB supports on&ndash;demand compilation and code injection into programs running under GDB. GCC 5.0 or higher built with libcc1.so must be installed for this functionality to be enabled. This functionality is implemented with the following commands.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>compile code source&ndash;code</li>
	<li>compile code &ndash;raw &ndash;&ndash; source&ndash;code</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Compile source&ndash;code with the compiler language found as the current language in GDB (see Languages). If compilation and injection is not supported with the current language specified in GDB, or the compiler does not support this feature, an error message will be printed. If source&ndash;code compiles and links successfully, GDB will load the object&ndash;code emitted, and execute it within the context of the currently selected inferior. It is important to note that the compiled code is executed immediately. After execution, the compiled code is removed from GDB and any new types or variables you have defined will be deleted.
	</p>
	<p>
		The command allows you to specify source&ndash;code in two ways. The simplest method is to provide a single line of code to the command. E.g.:
	</p>
	<pre><code>compile code printf ("hello world\n");	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If you specify options on the command line as well as source code, they may conflict. The &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; delimiter can be used to separate options from actual source code. E.g.:
	</p>
	<pre><code>compile code -r -- printf ("hello world\n");	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Alternatively you can enter source code as multiple lines of text. To enter this mode, invoke the &lsquo;compile code&rsquo; command without any text following the command. This will start the multiple&ndash;line editor and allow you to type as many lines of source code as required. When you have completed typing, enter &lsquo;end&rsquo; on its own line to exit the editor.
	</p>
	<pre><code>compile code
&gt;printf ("hello\n");
&gt;printf ("world\n");
&gt;end	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Specifying &lsquo;&ndash;raw&rsquo;, prohibits GDB from wrapping the provided source&ndash;code in a callable scope. In this case, you must specify the entry point of the code by defining a function named <em>gdb</em>expr_. The &lsquo;&ndash;raw&rsquo; code cannot access variables of the inferior. Using &lsquo;&ndash;raw&rsquo; option may be needed for example when source&ndash;code requires &lsquo;#include&rsquo; lines which may conflict with inferior symbols otherwise.
	</p>
	<li>compile file filename</li>
	<li>compile file &ndash;raw filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Like compile code, but take the source code from filename.
	</p>
	<pre><code>compile file /home/user/example.c	</code></pre>
	<li>compile print [[options] &ndash;&ndash;] expr</li>
	<li>compile print [[options] &ndash;&ndash;] /f expr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Compile and execute expr with the compiler language found as the current language in GDB (see Languages). By default the value of expr is printed in a format appropriate to its data type; you can choose a different format by specifying &lsquo;/f&rsquo;, where f is a letter specifying the format; see Output Formats. The compile print command accepts the same options as the print command; see print options.
	</p>
	<li>compile print [[options] &ndash;&ndash;]</li>
	<li>compile print [[options] &ndash;&ndash;] /f</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Alternatively you can enter the expression (source code producing it) as multiple lines of text. To enter this mode, invoke the &lsquo;compile print&rsquo; command without any text following the command. This will start the multiple&ndash;line editor.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The process of compiling and injecting the code can be inspected using:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set debug compile</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Turns on or off display of GDB process of compiling and injecting the code. The default is off.
	</p>
	<li>show debug compile</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays the current state of displaying GDB process of compiling and injecting the code.
	</p>
	<li>set debug compile&ndash;cplus&ndash;types</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Turns on or off the display of C++ type conversion debugging information. The default is off.
	</p>
	<li>show debug compile&ndash;cplus&ndash;types</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays the current state of displaying debugging information for C++ type conversion.
	</p>
</ul>

<p>
	GDB needs to specify the right compilation options for the code to be injected, in part to make its ABI compatible with the inferior and in part to make the injected code compatible with GDB&rsquo;s injecting process.
</p>
<p>
	The options used, in increasing precedence:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>target architecture and OS options (gdbarch)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These options depend on target processor type and target operating system, usually they specify at least 32&ndash;bit (&ndash;m32) or 64&ndash;bit (&ndash;m64) compilation option.
	</p>
	<li>compilation options recorded in the target</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GCC (since version 4.7) stores the options used for compilation into DW_AT_producer part of DWARF debugging information according to the GCC option &ndash;grecord&ndash;gcc&ndash;switches. One has to explicitly specify &ndash;g during inferior compilation otherwise GCC produces no DWARF. This feature is only relevant for platforms where &ndash;g produces DWARF by default, otherwise one may try to enforce DWARF by using &ndash;gdwarf&ndash;4.
	</p>
	<li>compilation options set by set compile&ndash;args</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	You can override compilation options using the following command:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set compile&ndash;args</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set compilation options used for compiling and injecting code with the compile commands. These options override any conflicting ones from the target architecture and/or options stored during inferior compilation.
	</p>
	<li>show compile&ndash;args</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays the current state of compilation options override. This does not show all the options actually used during compilation, use set debug compile for that.

	<H3><a name="HEAD_109b5fe7" href="#TOC_HEAD_109b5fe7">17.7.2 Caveats when using the compile command</a></H3>
<p>
	There are a few caveats to keep in mind when using the compile command. As the caveats are different per language, the table below highlights specific issues on a per language basis.
</p>
<p>
	C code examples and caveats
</p>
<pre><code>When the language in GDB is set to ‘C’, the compiler will attempt to compile the source code with a ‘C’ compiler. The source code provided to the compile command will have much the same access to variables and types as it normally would if it were part of the program currently being debugged in GDB.

Below is a sample program that forms the basis of the examples that follow. This program has been compiled and loaded into GDB, much like any other normal debugging session.

    void function1 (void)
    {
    int i = 42;
    printf ("function 1\n");
    }

    void function2 (void)
    {
    int j = 12;
    function1 ();
    }

    int main(void)
    {
    int k = 6;
    int *p;
    function2 ();
    return 0;
    }

For the purposes of the examples in this section, the program above has been compiled, loaded into GDB, stopped at the function main, and GDB is awaiting input from the user.

To access variables and types for any program in GDB, the program must be compiled and packaged with debug information. The compile command is not an exception to this rule. Without debug information, you can still use the compile command, but you will be very limited in what variables and types you can access.

So with that in mind, the example above has been compiled with debug information enabled. The compile command will have access to all variables and types (except those that may have been optimized out). Currently, as GDB has stopped the program in the main function, the compile command would have access to the variable k. You could invoke the compile command and type some source code to set the value of k. You can also read it, or do anything with that variable you would normally do in C. Be aware that changes to inferior variables in the compile command are persistent. In the following example:

    compile code k = 3;

the variable k is now 3. It will retain that value until something else in the example program changes it, or another compile command changes it.

Normal scope and access rules apply to source code compiled and injected by the compile command. In the example, the variables j and k are not accessible yet, because the program is currently stopped in the main function, where these variables are not in scope. Therefore, the following command

    compile code j = 3;

will result in a compilation error message.

Once the program is continued, execution will bring these variables in scope, and they will become accessible; then the code you specify via the compile command will be able to access them.

You can create variables and types with the compile command as part of your source code. Variables and types that are created as part of the compile command are not visible to the rest of the program for the duration of its run. This example is valid:

    compile code int ff = 5; printf ("ff is %d\n", ff);

However, if you were to type the following into GDB after that command has completed:

    compile code printf ("ff is %d\n'', ff);

a compiler error would be raised as the variable ff no longer exists. Object code generated and injected by the compile command is removed when its execution ends. Caution is advised when assigning to program variables values of variables created by the code submitted to the compile command. This example is valid:

    compile code int ff = 5; k = ff;

The value of the variable ff is assigned to k. The variable k does not require the existence of ff to maintain the value it has been assigned. However, pointers require particular care in assignment. If the source code compiled with the compile command changed the address of a pointer in the example program, perhaps to a variable created in the compile command, that pointer would point to an invalid location when the command exits. The following example would likely cause issues with your debugged program:

    compile code int ff = 5; p = &ff;

In this example, p would point to ff when the compile command is executing the source code provided to it. However, as variables in the (example) program persist with their assigned values, the variable p would point to an invalid location when the command exists. A general rule should be followed in that you should either assign NULL to any assigned pointers, or restore a valid location to the pointer before the command exits.

Similar caution must be exercised with any structs, unions, and typedefs defined in compile command. Types defined in the compile command will no longer be available in the next compile command. Therefore, if you cast a variable to a type defined in the compile command, care must be taken to ensure that any future need to resolve the type can be achieved.

    (gdb) compile code static struct a { int a; } v = { 42 }; argv = &v;
    (gdb) compile code printf ("%d\n", ((struct a *) argv)-&gt;a);
    gdb command line:1:36: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type âstruct aâ
    Compilation failed.
    (gdb) compile code struct a { int a; }; printf ("%d\n", ((struct a *) argv)-&gt;a);
    42

Variables that have been optimized away by the compiler are not accessible to the code submitted to the compile command. Access to those variables will generate a compiler error which GDB will print to the console.</code></pre>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_64268835" href="#TOC_HEAD_64268835">17.7.3 Compiler search for the compile command</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB needs to find GCC for the inferior being debugged which may not be obvious for remote targets of different architecture than where GDB is running. Environment variable PATH on GDB host is searched for GCC binary matching the target architecture and operating system. This search can be overriden by set compile&ndash;gcc GDB command below. PATH is taken from shell that executed GDB, it is not the value set by GDB command set environment). See Environment.
</p>
<p>
	Specifically PATH is searched for binaries matching regular expression arch(&ndash;[&circ;&ndash;]*)?&ndash;os&ndash;gcc according to the inferior target being debugged. arch is processor name &mdash; multiarch is supported, so for example both i386 and x86_64 targets look for pattern (x86_64|i.86) and both s390 and s390x targets look for pattern s390x?. os is currently supported only for pattern linux(&ndash;gnu)?.
</p>
<p>
	On Posix hosts the compiler driver GDB needs to find also shared library libcc1.so from the compiler. It is searched in default shared library search path (overridable with usual environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH), unrelated to PATH or set compile&ndash;gcc settings. Contrary to it libcc1plugin.so is found according to the installation of the found compiler &mdash; as possibly specified by the set compile&ndash;gcc command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set compile&ndash;gcc</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set compilation command used for compiling and injecting code with the compile commands. If this option is not set (it is set to an empty string), the search described above will occur &mdash; that is the default.
	</p>
	<li>show compile&ndash;gcc</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays the current compile command GCC driver filename. If set, it is the main command gcc, found usually for example under name x86_64&ndash;linux&ndash;gnu&ndash;gcc.

</ul>
	<H1><a name="HEAD_2902bec3" href="#TOC_HEAD_2902bec3">18 GDB Files</a></H1>
<p>
	GDB needs to know the file name of the program to be debugged, both in order to read its symbol table and in order to start your program. To debug a core dump of a previous run, you must also tell GDB the name of the core dump file.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_260209d5" href="#TOC_HEAD_260209d5">18.1 Commands to Specify Files</a></H2>
<p>
	You may want to specify executable and core dump file names. The usual way to do this is at start&ndash;up time, using the arguments to GDB&rsquo;s start&ndash;up commands (see Getting In and Out of GDB).
</p>
<p>
	Occasionally it is necessary to change to a different file during a GDB session. Or you may run GDB and forget to specify a file you want to use. Or you are debugging a remote target via gdbserver (see Using the gdbserver Program). In these situations the GDB commands to specify new files are useful.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="HEAD_HIDDEN_be48a82b">file filename &nbsp;<a href="../tags/gdb-file.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>gdb-file</a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use filename as the program to be debugged. It is read for its symbols and for the contents of pure memory. It is also the program executed when you use the run command. If you do not specify a directory and the file is not found in the GDB working directory, GDB uses the environment variable PATH as a list of directories to search, just as the shell does when looking for a program to run. You can change the value of this variable, for both GDB and your program, using the path command.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can load unlinked object .o files into GDB using the file command. You will not be able to &ldquo;run&rdquo; an object file, but you can disassemble functions and inspect variables. Also, if the underlying BFD functionality supports it, you could use gdb &ndash;write to patch object files using this technique. Note that GDB can neither interpret nor modify relocations in this case, so branches and some initialized variables will appear to go to the wrong place. But this feature is still handy from time to time.
	</p>
	<li>file</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		file with no argument makes GDB discard any information it has on both executable file and the symbol table.
	</p>
	<li>exec&ndash;file [ filename ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specify that the program to be run (but not the symbol table) is found in filename. GDB searches the environment variable PATH if necessary to locate your program. Omitting filename means to discard information on the executable file.
	</p>
	<li><a name="HEAD_HIDDEN_c17ee8d9">symbol&ndash;file [ filename [ &ndash;o offset ]]  &nbsp;<a href="../tags/gdb-symbol-file.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>gdb-symbol-file</a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Read symbol table information from file filename. PATH is searched when necessary. Use the file command to get both symbol table and program to run from the same file.
	</p>
	<p>
		If an optional offset is specified, it is added to the start address of each section in the symbol file. This is useful if the program is relocated at runtime, such as the Linux kernel with kASLR enabled.
	</p>
	<p>
		symbol&ndash;file with no argument clears out GDB information on your program&rsquo;s symbol table.
	</p>
	<p>
		The symbol&ndash;file command causes GDB to forget the contents of some breakpoints and auto&ndash;display expressions. This is because they may contain pointers to the internal data recording symbols and data types, which are part of the old symbol table data being discarded inside GDB.
	</p>
	<p>
		symbol&ndash;file does not repeat if you press RET again after executing it once.
	</p>
	<p>
		When GDB is configured for a particular environment, it understands debugging information in whatever format is the standard generated for that environment; you may use either a GNU compiler, or other compilers that adhere to the local conventions. Best results are usually obtained from GNU compilers; for example, using GCC you can generate debugging information for optimized code.
	</p>
	<p>
		For most kinds of object files, with the exception of old SVR3 systems using COFF, the symbol&ndash;file command does not normally read the symbol table in full right away. Instead, it scans the symbol table quickly to find which source files and which symbols are present. The details are read later, one source file at a time, as they are needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The purpose of this two&ndash;stage reading strategy is to make GDB start up faster. For the most part, it is invisible except for occasional pauses while the symbol table details for a particular source file are being read. (The set verbose command can turn these pauses into messages if desired. See Optional Warnings and Messages.)
	</p>
	<p>
		We have not implemented the two&ndash;stage strategy for COFF yet. When the symbol table is stored in COFF format, symbol&ndash;file reads the symbol table data in full right away. Note that &ldquo;stabs&ndash;in&ndash;COFF&rdquo; still does the two&ndash;stage strategy, since the debug info is actually in stabs format.
	</p>
	<li>symbol&ndash;file [ &ndash;readnow ] filename</li>
	<li>file [ &ndash;readnow ] filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		You can override the GDB two&ndash;stage strategy for reading symbol tables by using the &lsquo;&ndash;readnow&rsquo; option with any of the commands that load symbol table information, if you want to be sure GDB has the entire symbol table available.
	</p>
	<li>symbol&ndash;file [ &ndash;readnever ] filename</li>
	<li>file [ &ndash;readnever ] filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		You can instruct GDB to never read the symbolic information contained in filename by using the &lsquo;&ndash;readnever&rsquo; option. See &ndash;&ndash;readnever.
	</p>
	<li>core&ndash;file [filename]</li>
	<li>core</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specify the whereabouts of a core dump file to be used as the &ldquo;contents of memory&rdquo;. Traditionally, core files contain only some parts of the address space of the process that generated them; GDB can access the executable file itself for other parts.
	</p>
	<p>
		core&ndash;file with no argument specifies that no core file is to be used.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the core file is ignored when your program is actually running under GDB. So, if you have been running your program and you wish to debug a core file instead, you must kill the subprocess in which the program is running. To do this, use the kill command (see Killing the Child Process).
	</p>
	<li>add&ndash;symbol&ndash;file filename [ &ndash;readnow | &ndash;readnever ] [ &ndash;o offset ] [ textaddress ] [ &ndash;s section address &hellip; ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The add&ndash;symbol&ndash;file command reads additional symbol table information from the file filename. You would use this command when filename has been dynamically loaded (by some other means) into the program that is running. The textaddress parameter gives the memory address at which the file&rsquo;s text section has been loaded. You can additionally specify the base address of other sections using an arbitrary number of &lsquo;&ndash;s section address&rsquo; pairs. If a section is omitted, GDB will use its default addresses as found in filename. Any address or textaddress can be given as an expression.
	</p>
	<p>
		If an optional offset is specified, it is added to the start address of each section, except those for which the address was specified explicitly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The symbol table of the file filename is added to the symbol table originally read with the symbol&ndash;file command. You can use the add&ndash;symbol&ndash;file command any number of times; the new symbol data thus read is kept in addition to the old.
	</p>
	<p>
		Changes can be reverted using the command remove&ndash;symbol&ndash;file.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although filename is typically a shared library file, an executable file, or some other object file which has been fully relocated for loading into a process, you can also load symbolic information from relocatable .o files, as long as:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the file&rsquo;s symbolic information refers only to linker symbols defined in that file, not to symbols defined by other object files,</li>
		<li>every section the file&rsquo;s symbolic information refers to has actually been loaded into the inferior, as it appears in the file, and</li>
		<li>you can determine the address at which every section was loaded, and provide these to the add&ndash;symbol&ndash;file command.</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<p>
		Some embedded operating systems, like Sun Chorus and VxWorks, can load relocatable files into an already running program; such systems typically make the requirements above easy to meet. However, it&rsquo;s important to recognize that many native systems use complex link procedures (.linkonce section factoring and C++ constructor table assembly, for example) that make the requirements difficult to meet. In general, one cannot assume that using add&ndash;symbol&ndash;file to read a relocatable object file&rsquo;s symbolic information will have the same effect as linking the relocatable object file into the program in the normal way.
	</p>
	<pre><code>add-symbol-file does not repeat if you press RET after using it.	</code></pre>
	<li>remove&ndash;symbol&ndash;file filename</li>
	<li>remove&ndash;symbol&ndash;file &ndash;a address</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Remove a symbol file added via the add&ndash;symbol&ndash;file command. The file to remove can be identified by its filename or by an address that lies within the boundaries of this symbol file in memory. Example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) add-symbol-file /home/user/gdb/mylib.so 0x7ffff7ff9480
add symbol table from file "/home/user/gdb/mylib.so" at
    .text_addr = 0x7ffff7ff9480
(y or n) y
Reading symbols from /home/user/gdb/mylib.so...
(gdb) remove-symbol-file -a 0x7ffff7ff9480
Remove symbol table from file "/home/user/gdb/mylib.so"? (y or n) y
(gdb)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		remove&ndash;symbol&ndash;file does not repeat if you press RET after using it.
	</p>
	<li>add&ndash;symbol&ndash;file&ndash;from&ndash;memory address</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Load symbols from the given address in a dynamically loaded object file whose image is mapped directly into the inferior&rsquo;s memory. For example, the Linux kernel maps a syscall DSO into each process&rsquo;s address space; this DSO provides kernel&ndash;specific code for some system calls. The argument can be any expression whose evaluation yields the address of the file&rsquo;s shared object file header. For this command to work, you must have used symbol&ndash;file or exec&ndash;file commands in advance.
	</p>
	<li>section section addr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The section command changes the base address of the named section of the exec file to addr. This can be used if the exec file does not contain section addresses, (such as in the a.out format), or when the addresses specified in the file itself are wrong. Each section must be changed separately. The info files command, described below, lists all the sections and their addresses.
	</p>
	<li>info files</li>
	<li>info target</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		info files and info target are synonymous; both print the current target (see Specifying a Debugging Target), including the names of the executable and core dump files currently in use by GDB, and the files from which symbols were loaded. The command help target lists all possible targets rather than current ones.
	</p>
	<li>maint info sections [&ndash;all&ndash;objects] [filter&ndash;list]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Another command that can give you extra information about program sections is maint info sections. In addition to the section information displayed by info files, this command displays the flags and file offset of each section in the executable and core dump files.
	</p>
	<p>
		When &lsquo;&ndash;all&ndash;objects&rsquo; is passed then sections from all loaded object files, including shared libraries, are printed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The optional filter&ndash;list is a space separated list of filter keywords. Sections that match any one of the filter criteria will be printed. There are two types of filter:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>section&ndash;name</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display information about any section named section&ndash;name.
		</p>
		<li>section&ndash;flag</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Display information for any section with section&ndash;flag. The section flags that GDB currently knows about are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ALLOC</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section will have space allocated in the process when loaded. Set for all sections except those containing debug information.
			</p>
			<li>LOAD</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section will be loaded from the file into the child process memory. Set for pre&ndash;initialized code and data, clear for .bss sections.
			</p>
			<li>RELOC</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section needs to be relocated before loading.
			</p>
			<li>READONLY</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section cannot be modified by the child process.
			</p>
			<li>CODE</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section contains executable code only.
			</p>
			<li>DATA</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section contains data only (no executable code).
			</p>
			<li>ROM</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section will reside in ROM.
			</p>
			<li>CONSTRUCTOR</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section contains data for constructor/destructor lists.
			</p>
			<li>HAS_CONTENTS</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section is not empty.
			</p>
			<li>NEVER_LOAD</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				An instruction to the linker to not output the section.
			</p>
			<li>COFF_SHARED_LIBRARY</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				A notification to the linker that the section contains COFF shared library information.
			</p>
			<li>IS_COMMON</li>
			<br />
			<p>
				Section contains common symbols.
			</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>maint info target&ndash;sections</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command prints GDB&rsquo;s internal section table. For each target GDB maintains a table containing the allocatable sections from all currently mapped objects, along with information about where the section is mapped.
	</p>
	<li>set trust&ndash;readonly&ndash;sections on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB that readonly sections in your object file really are read&ndash;only (i.e. that their contents will not change). In that case, GDB can fetch values from these sections out of the object file, rather than from the target program. For some targets (notably embedded ones), this can be a significant enhancement to debugging performance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default is off.
	</p>
	<li>set trust&ndash;readonly&ndash;sections off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB not to trust readonly sections. This means that the contents of the section might change while the program is running, and must therefore be fetched from the target when needed.
	</p>
	<li>show trust&ndash;readonly&ndash;sections</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of trusting readonly sections.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	All file&ndash;specifying commands allow both absolute and relative file names as arguments. GDB always converts the file name to an absolute file name and remembers it that way.
</p>
<p>
	GDB supports GNU/Linux, MS&ndash;Windows, SunOS, Darwin/Mach&ndash;O, SVr4, IBM RS/6000 AIX, QNX Neutrino, FDPIC (FR&ndash;V), and DSBT (TIC6X) shared libraries.
</p>
<p>
	On MS&ndash;Windows GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support shared libraries. See Expat.
</p>
<p>
	GDB automatically loads symbol definitions from shared libraries when you use the run command, or when you examine a core file. (Before you issue the run command, GDB does not understand references to a function in a shared library, however&mdash;unless you are debugging a core file).
</p>
<p>
	There are times, however, when you may wish to not automatically load symbol definitions from shared libraries, such as when they are particularly large or there are many of them.
</p>
<p>
	To control the automatic loading of shared library symbols, use the commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set auto&ndash;solib&ndash;add mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If mode is on, symbols from all shared object libraries will be loaded automatically when the inferior begins execution, you attach to an independently started inferior, or when the dynamic linker informs GDB that a new library has been loaded. If mode is off, symbols must be loaded manually, using the sharedlibrary command. The default value is on.
	</p>
	<p>
		If your program uses lots of shared libraries with debug info that takes large amounts of memory, you can decrease the GDB memory footprint by preventing it from automatically loading the symbols from shared libraries. To that end, type set auto&ndash;solib&ndash;add off before running the inferior, then load each library whose debug symbols you do need with sharedlibrary regexp, where regexp is a regular expression that matches the libraries whose symbols you want to be loaded.
	</p>
	<li>show auto&ndash;solib&ndash;add</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current autoloading mode.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	To explicitly load shared library symbols, use the sharedlibrary command:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info share regex</li>
	<li>info sharedlibrary regex</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the names of the shared libraries which are currently loaded that match regex. If regex is omitted then print all shared libraries that are loaded.
	</p>
	<li>info dll regex</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is an alias of info sharedlibrary.
	</p>
	<li>sharedlibrary regex</li>
	<li>share regex</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Load shared object library symbols for files matching a Unix regular expression. As with files loaded automatically, it only loads shared libraries required by your program for a core file or after typing run. If regex is omitted all shared libraries required by your program are loaded.
	</p>
	<li>nosharedlibrary</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Unload all shared object library symbols. This discards all symbols that have been loaded from all shared libraries. Symbols from shared libraries that were loaded by explicit user requests are not discarded.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Sometimes you may wish that GDB stops and gives you control when any of shared library events happen. The best way to do this is to use catch load and catch unload (see Set Catchpoints).
</p>
<p>
	GDB also supports the set stop&ndash;on&ndash;solib&ndash;events command for this. This command exists for historical reasons. It is less useful than setting a catchpoint, because it does not allow for conditions or commands as a catchpoint does.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set stop&ndash;on&ndash;solib&ndash;events</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command controls whether GDB should give you control when the dynamic linker notifies it about some shared library event. The most common event of interest is loading or unloading of a new shared library.
	</p>
	<li>show stop&ndash;on&ndash;solib&ndash;events</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether GDB stops and gives you control when shared library events happen.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Shared libraries are also supported in many cross or remote debugging configurations. GDB needs to have access to the target&rsquo;s libraries; this can be accomplished either by providing copies of the libraries on the host system, or by asking GDB to automatically retrieve the libraries from the target. If copies of the target libraries are provided, they need to be the same as the target libraries, although the copies on the target can be stripped as long as the copies on the host are not.
</p>
<p>
	For remote debugging, you need to tell GDB where the target libraries are, so that it can load the correct copies&mdash;otherwise, it may try to load the host&rsquo;s libraries. GDB has two variables to specify the search directories for target libraries.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set sysroot path</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use path as the system root for the program being debugged. Any absolute shared library paths will be prefixed with path; many runtime loaders store the absolute paths to the shared library in the target program&rsquo;s memory. When starting processes remotely, and when attaching to already&ndash;running processes (local or remote), their executable filenames will be prefixed with path if reported to GDB as absolute by the operating system. If you use set sysroot to find executables and shared libraries, they need to be laid out in the same way that they are on the target, with e.g. a /bin, /lib and /usr/lib hierarchy under path.
	</p>
	<p>
		If path starts with the sequence target: and the target system is remote then GDB will retrieve the target binaries from the remote system. This is only supported when using a remote target that supports the remote get command (see Sending files to a remote system). The part of path following the initial target: (if present) is used as system root prefix on the remote file system. If path starts with the sequence remote: this is converted to the sequence target: by set sysroot15. If you want to specify a local system root using a directory that happens to be named target: or remote:, you need to use some equivalent variant of the name like ./target:.
	</p>
	<p>
		For targets with an MS&ndash;DOS based filesystem, such as MS&ndash;Windows, GDB tries prefixing a few variants of the target absolute file name with path. But first, on Unix hosts, GDB converts all backslash directory separators into forward slashes, because the backslash is not a directory separator on Unix:
	</p>
	<pre><code>c:\foo\bar.dll ⇒ c:/foo/bar.dll	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Then, GDB attempts prefixing the target file name with path, and looks for the resulting file name in the host file system:
	</p>
	<pre><code>c:/foo/bar.dll ⇒ /path/to/sysroot/c:/foo/bar.dll	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If that does not find the binary, GDB tries removing the &lsquo;:&rsquo; character from the drive spec, both for convenience, and, for the case of the host file system not supporting file names with colons:
	</p>
	<pre><code>c:/foo/bar.dll ⇒ /path/to/sysroot/c/foo/bar.dll	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This makes it possible to have a system root that mirrors a target with more than one drive. E.g., you may want to setup your local copies of the target system shared libraries like so (note &lsquo;c&rsquo; vs &lsquo;z&rsquo;):
	</p>
	<pre><code>/path/to/sysroot/c/sys/bin/foo.dll
/path/to/sysroot/c/sys/bin/bar.dll
/path/to/sysroot/z/sys/bin/bar.dll	</code></pre>
	<p>
		and point the system root at /path/to/sysroot, so that GDB can find the correct copies of both c:\sys\bin\foo.dll, and z:\sys\bin\bar.dll.
	</p>
	<p>
		If that still does not find the binary, GDB tries removing the whole drive spec from the target file name:
	</p>
	<pre><code>c:/foo/bar.dll ⇒ /path/to/sysroot/foo/bar.dll	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This last lookup makes it possible to not care about the drive name, if you don&rsquo;t want or need to.
	</p>
	<p>
		The set solib&ndash;absolute&ndash;prefix command is an alias for set sysroot.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can set the default system root by using the configure&ndash;time &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;sysroot&rsquo; option. If the system root is inside GDB&rsquo;s configured binary prefix (set with &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;prefix&rsquo; or &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;exec&ndash;prefix&rsquo;), then the default system root will be updated automatically if the installed GDB is moved to a new location.
	</p>
	<li>show sysroot</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current executable and shared library prefix.
	</p>
	<li>set solib&ndash;search&ndash;path path</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If this variable is set, path is a colon&ndash;separated list of directories to search for shared libraries. &lsquo;solib&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; is used after &lsquo;sysroot&rsquo; fails to locate the library, or if the path to the library is relative instead of absolute. If you want to use &lsquo;solib&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;sysroot&rsquo;, be sure to set &lsquo;sysroot&rsquo; to a nonexistent directory to prevent GDB from finding your host&rsquo;s libraries. &lsquo;sysroot&rsquo; is preferred; setting it to a nonexistent directory may interfere with automatic loading of shared library symbols.
	</p>
	<li>show solib&ndash;search&ndash;path</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current shared library search path.
	</p>
	<li>set target&ndash;file&ndash;system&ndash;kind kind</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set assumed file system kind for target reported file names.
	</p>
	<p>
		Shared library file names as reported by the target system may not make sense as is on the system GDB is running on. For example, when remote debugging a target that has MS&ndash;DOS based file system semantics, from a Unix host, the target may be reporting to GDB a list of loaded shared libraries with file names such as c:\Windows\kernel32.dll. On Unix hosts, there&rsquo;s no concept of drive letters, so the &lsquo;c:\&rsquo; prefix is not normally understood as indicating an absolute file name, and neither is the backslash normally considered a directory separator character. In that case, the native file system would interpret this whole absolute file name as a relative file name with no directory components. This would make it impossible to point GDB at a copy of the remote target&rsquo;s shared libraries on the host using set sysroot, and impractical with set solib&ndash;search&ndash;path. Setting target&ndash;file&ndash;system&ndash;kind to dos&ndash;based tells GDB to interpret such file names similarly to how the target would, and to map them to file names valid on GDB&rsquo;s native file system semantics. The value of kind can be &quot;auto&quot;, in addition to one of the supported file system kinds. In that case, GDB tries to determine the appropriate file system variant based on the current target&rsquo;s operating system (see Configuring the Current ABI). The supported file system settings are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>unix</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Instruct GDB to assume the target file system is of Unix kind. Only file names starting the forward slash (&lsquo;/&rsquo;) character are considered absolute, and the directory separator character is also the forward slash.
		</p>
		<li>dos&ndash;based</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Instruct GDB to assume the target file system is DOS based. File names starting with either a forward slash, or a drive letter followed by a colon (e.g., &lsquo;c:&rsquo;), are considered absolute, and both the slash (&lsquo;/&rsquo;) and the backslash (&lsquo;\\&rsquo;) characters are considered directory separators.
		</p>
		<li>auto</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Instruct GDB to use the file system kind associated with the target operating system (see Configuring the Current ABI). This is the default.
		</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	When processing file names provided by the user, GDB frequently needs to compare them to the file names recorded in the program&rsquo;s debug info. Normally, GDB compares just the base names of the files as strings, which is reasonably fast even for very large programs. (The base name of a file is the last portion of its name, after stripping all the leading directories.) This shortcut in comparison is based upon the assumption that files cannot have more than one base name. This is usually true, but references to files that use symlinks or similar filesystem facilities violate that assumption. If your program records files using such facilities, or if you provide file names to GDB using symlinks etc., you can set basenames&ndash;may&ndash;differ to true to instruct GDB to completely canonicalize each pair of file names it needs to compare. This will make file&ndash;name comparisons accurate, but at a price of a significant slowdown.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set basenames&ndash;may&ndash;differ</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set whether a source file may have multiple base names.
	</p>
	<li>show basenames&ndash;may&ndash;differ</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether a source file may have multiple base names.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_157884f0" href="#TOC_HEAD_157884f0">18.2 File Caching</a></H2>
<p>
	To speed up file loading, and reduce memory usage, GDB will reuse the bfd objects used to track open files. See BFD in The Binary File Descriptor Library. The following commands allow visibility and control of the caching behavior.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>maint info bfds</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This prints information about each bfd object that is known to GDB.
	</p>
	<li>maint set bfd&ndash;sharing</li>
	<li>maint show bfd&ndash;sharing</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control whether bfd objects can be shared. When sharing is enabled GDB reuses already open bfd objects rather than reopening the same file. Turning sharing off does not cause already shared bfd objects to be unshared, but all future files that are opened will create a new bfd object. Similarly, re&ndash;enabling sharing does not cause multiple existing bfd objects to be collapsed into a single shared bfd object.
	</p>
	<li>set debug bfd&ndash;cache level</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Turns on debugging of the bfd cache, setting the level to level.
	</p>
	<li>show debug bfd&ndash;cache</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current debugging level of the bfd cache.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="GDB-USER-MANUAL-SEP-FILE-1" href="#TOC_GDB-USER-MANUAL-SEP-FILE-1">18.3 Debugging Information in Separate Files</a></H2><ul><a href="../tags/Debug-Separate-File.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>Debug-Separate-File</a>&nbsp;</ul>
<p>
	GDB allows you to put a program&rsquo;s debugging information in a file separate from the executable itself, in a way that allows GDB to find and load the debugging information automatically. Since debugging information can be very large&mdash;sometimes larger than the executable code itself&mdash;some systems distribute debugging information for their executables in separate files, which users can install only when they need to debug a problem.
</p>
<p>
	GDB supports two ways of specifying the separate debug info file:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The executable contains a <strong>debug link</strong> that specifies the name of the separate debug info file. The separate debug file&rsquo;s name is usually executable.debug, where executable is the name of the corresponding executable file without leading directories (e.g., ls.debug for /usr/bin/ls). In addition, the debug link specifies a 32&ndash;bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) checksum for the debug file, which GDB uses to validate that the executable and the debug file came from the same build.</li>
	<li>The executable contains a <strong>build ID</strong> , a unique bit string that is also present in the corresponding debug info file. (This is supported only on some operating systems, when using the ELF or PE file formats for binary files and the GNU Binutils.) For more details about this feature, see the description of the &ndash;&ndash;build&ndash;id command&ndash;line option in Command Line Options in The GNU Linker. The debug info file&rsquo;s name is not specified explicitly by the build ID, but can be computed from the build ID, see below.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	Depending on the way the debug info file is specified, GDB uses two different methods of looking for the debug file:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>For the <strong>debug link</strong> method, GDB looks up the named file in the directory of the executable file, then in a subdirectory of that directory named .debug, and finally under each one of the global debug directories, in a subdirectory whose name is identical to the leading directories of the executable&rsquo;s absolute file name. (On MS&ndash;Windows/MS&ndash;DOS, the drive letter of the executable&rsquo;s leading directories is converted to a one&ndash;letter subdirectory, i.e. d:/usr/bin/ is converted to /d/usr/bin/, because Windows filesystems disallow colons in file names.)</li>
	<li>For the <strong>build ID</strong> method, GDB looks in the .build&ndash;id subdirectory of each one of the global debug directories for a file named nn/nnnnnnnn.debug, where nn are the first 2 hex characters of the build ID bit string, and nnnnnnnn are the rest of the bit string. (Real build ID strings are 32 or more hex characters, not 10.) GDB can automatically query debuginfod servers using build IDs in order to download separate debug files that cannot be found locally. For more information see Debuginfod.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	So, for example, suppose you ask GDB to debug /usr/bin/ls, which has a debug link that specifies the file ls.debug, and a build ID whose value in hex is abcdef1234. If the list of the global debug directories includes /usr/lib/debug, then GDB will look for the following debug information files, in the indicated order:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>/usr/lib/debug/.build&ndash;id/ab/cdef1234.debug</li>
	<li>/usr/bin/ls.debug</li>
	<li>/usr/bin/.debug/ls.debug</li>
	<li>/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/ls.debug.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	If the debug file still has not been found and debuginfod (see Debuginfod) is enabled, GDB will attempt to download the file from debuginfod servers.
</p>
<p>
	Global debugging info directories default to what is set by GDB configure option <code>&ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;separate&ndash;debug&ndash;dir</code> . During GDB run you can also set the global debugging info directories, and view the list GDB is currently using.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set debug&ndash;file&ndash;directory directories</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the directories which GDB searches for separate debugging information files to directory. Multiple path components can be set concatenating them by a path separator.
	</p>
	<li>show debug&ndash;file&ndash;directory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the directories GDB searches for separate debugging information files.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	A debug link is a special section of the executable file named .gnu_debuglink. The section must contain:
</p>
<pre><code>A filename, with any leading directory components removed, followed by a zero byte,
zero to three bytes of padding, as needed to reach the next four-byte boundary within the section, and
a four-byte CRC checksum, stored in the same endianness used for the executable file itself. The checksum is computed on the debugging information file’s full contents by the function given below, passing zero as the crc argument.</code></pre>
<p>
	Any executable file format can carry a debug link, as long as it can contain a section named .gnu_debuglink with the contents described above.
</p>
<p>
	The build ID is a special section in the executable file (and in other ELF binary files that GDB may consider). This section is often named .note.gnu.build&ndash;id, but that name is not mandatory. It contains unique identification for the built files&mdash;the ID remains the same across multiple builds of the same build tree. The default algorithm SHA1 produces 160 bits (40 hexadecimal characters) of the content for the build ID string. The same section with an identical value is present in the original built binary with symbols, in its stripped variant, and in the separate debugging information file.
</p>
<p>
	The debugging information file itself should be an ordinary executable, containing a full set of linker symbols, sections, and debugging information. The sections of the debugging information file should have the same names, addresses, and sizes as the original file, but they need not contain any data&mdash;much like a .bss section in an ordinary executable.
</p>
<p>
	The GNU binary utilities (Binutils) package includes the &lsquo;objcopy&rsquo; utility that can produce the separated executable / debugging information file pairs using the following commands:
</p>
<pre><code>objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.debug
strip -g foo</code></pre>
<p>
	These commands remove the debugging information from the executable file foo and place it in the file foo.debug. You can use the first, second or both methods to link the two files:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The debug link method needs the following additional command to also leave behind a debug link in foo:</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.debug foo	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Ulrich Drepper&rsquo;s elfutils package, starting with version 0.53, contains a version of the strip command such that the command strip foo &ndash;f foo.debug has the same functionality as the two objcopy commands and the ln &ndash;s command above, together.
	</p>
	<li>Build ID gets embedded into the main executable using ld &ndash;&ndash;build&ndash;id or the GCC counterpart gcc &ndash;Wl,&ndash;&ndash;build&ndash;id. Build ID support plus compatibility fixes for debug files separation are present in GNU binary utilities (Binutils) package since version 2.18.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	The CRC used in .gnu_debuglink is the CRC&ndash;32 defined in IEEE 802.3 using the polynomial:
</p>
<pre><code>x32 + x26 + x23 + x22 + x16 + x12 + x11
+ x10 + x8 + x7 + x5 + x4 + x2 + x + 1</code></pre>
<p>
	The function is computed byte at a time, taking the least significant bit of each byte first. The initial pattern 0xffffffff is used, to ensure leading zeros affect the CRC and the final result is inverted to ensure trailing zeros also affect the CRC.
</p>
<p>
	Note: This is the same CRC polynomial as used in handling the Remote Serial Protocol qCRC packet (see qCRC packet). However in the case of the Remote Serial Protocol, the CRC is computed most significant bit first, and the result is not inverted, so trailing zeros have no effect on the CRC value.
</p>
<p>
	To complete the description, we show below the code of the function which produces the CRC used in .gnu_debuglink. Inverting the initially supplied crc argument means that an initial call to this function passing in zero will start computing the CRC using 0xffffffff.
</p>

<p>
	Some systems ship pre&ndash;built executables and libraries that have a special &lsquo;.gnu_debugdata&rsquo; section. This feature is called MiniDebugInfo. This section holds an LZMA&ndash;compressed object and is used to supply extra symbols for backtraces.
</p>
<p>
	The intent of this section is to provide extra minimal debugging information for use in simple backtraces. It is not intended to be a replacement for full separate debugging information (see Separate Debug Files). The example below shows the intended use; however, GDB does not currently put restrictions on what sort of debugging information might be included in the section.
</p>
<p>
	GDB has support for this extension. If the section exists, then it is used provided that no other source of debugging information can be found, and that GDB was configured with LZMA support.
</p>
<p>
	This section can be easily created using objcopy and other standard utilities:
</p>
<pre><code># Extract the dynamic symbols from the main binary, there is no need
# to also have these in the normal symbol table.
nm -D binary --format=posix --defined-only \
| awk '{ print $1 }' | sort &gt; dynsyms

# Extract all the text (i.e. function) symbols from the debuginfo.
# (Note that we actually also accept "D" symbols, for the benefit
# of platforms like PowerPC64 that use function descriptors.)
nm binary --format=posix --defined-only \
| awk '{ if ($2 == "T" || $2 == "t" || $2 == "D") print $1 }' \
| sort &gt; funcsyms

# Keep all the function symbols not already in the dynamic symbol
# table.
comm -13 dynsyms funcsyms &gt; keep_symbols

# Separate full debug info into debug binary.
objcopy --only-keep-debug binary debug

# Copy the full debuginfo, keeping only a minimal set of symbols and
# removing some unnecessary sections.
objcopy -S --remove-section .gdb_index --remove-section .comment \
--keep-symbols=keep_symbols debug mini_debuginfo

# Drop the full debug info from the original binary.
strip --strip-all -R .comment binary

# Inject the compressed data into the .gnu_debugdata section of the
# original binary.

</div>
<p>
	When GDB finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the file in order to construct an internal symbol table. This lets most GDB operations work quickly&mdash;at the cost of a delay early on. For large programs, this delay can be quite lengthy, so GDB provides a way to build an index, which speeds up startup.
</p>
<p>
	For convenience, GDB comes with a program, gdb&ndash;add&ndash;index, which can be used to add the index to a symbol file. It takes the symbol file as its only argument:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb-add-index symfile</code></pre>
<p>
	See gdb&ndash;add&ndash;index.
</p>
<p>
	It is also possible to do the work manually. Here is what gdb&ndash;add&ndash;index does behind the curtains.
</p>
<p>
	The index is stored as a section in the symbol file. GDB can write the index to a file, then you can put it into the symbol file using objcopy.
</p>
<p>
	To create an index file, use the save gdb&ndash;index command:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>save gdb&ndash;index [&ndash;dwarf&ndash;5] directory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Create index files for all symbol files currently known by GDB. For each known symbol&ndash;file, this command by default creates it produces a single file symbol&ndash;file.gdb&ndash;index. If you invoke this command with the &ndash;dwarf&ndash;5 option, it produces 2 files: symbol&ndash;file.debug_names and symbol&ndash;file.debug_str. The files are created in the given directory.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Once you have created an index file you can merge it into your symbol file, here named symfile, using objcopy:
</p>
<pre><code>$ objcopy --add-section .gdb_index=symfile.gdb-index \
    --set-section-flags .gdb_index=readonly symfile symfile</code></pre>
<p>
	Or for &ndash;dwarf&ndash;5:
</p>
<pre><code>$ objcopy --dump-section .debug_str=symfile.debug_str.new symfile
$ cat symfile.debug_str &gt;&gt;symfile.debug_str.new
$ objcopy --add-section .debug_names=symfile.gdb-index \
    --set-section-flags .debug_names=readonly \
    --update-section .debug_str=symfile.debug_str.new symfile symfile</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB will normally ignore older versions of .gdb_index sections that have been deprecated. Usually they are deprecated because they are missing a new feature or have performance issues. To tell GDB to use a deprecated index section anyway specify set use&ndash;deprecated&ndash;index&ndash;sections on. The default is off. This can speed up startup, but may result in some functionality being lost. See Index Section Format.
</p>
<p>
	Warning: Setting use&ndash;deprecated&ndash;index&ndash;sections to on must be done before gdb reads the file. The following will not work:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb -ex "set use-deprecated-index-sections on" &lt;program&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	Instead you must do, for example,
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb -iex "set use-deprecated-index-sections on" &lt;program&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	Indices only work when using DWARF debugging information, not stabs.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_95ece1b0" href="#TOC_HEAD_95ece1b0">18.5.1 Automatic symbol index cache</a></H3>
<p>
	It is possible for GDB to automatically save a copy of this index in a cache on disk and retrieve it from there when loading the same binary in the future. This feature can be turned on with set index&ndash;cache enabled on. The following commands can be used to tweak the behavior of the index cache.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set index&ndash;cache enabled on</li>
	<li>set index&ndash;cache enabled off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable or disable the use of the symbol index cache.
	</p>
	<li>set index&ndash;cache directory directory</li>
	<li>show index&ndash;cache directory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set/show the directory where index files will be saved.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default value for this directory depends on the host platform. On most systems, the index is cached in the gdb subdirectory of the directory pointed to by the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable, if it is defined, else in the .cache/gdb subdirectory of your home directory. However, on some systems, the default may differ according to local convention.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is no limit on the disk space used by index cache. It is perfectly safe to delete the content of that directory to free up disk space.
	</p>
	<li>show index&ndash;cache stats</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the number of cache hits and misses since the launch of GDB.

	<H2><a name="HEAD_673dd627" href="#TOC_HEAD_673dd627">18.6 Errors Reading Symbol Files</a></H2>
<p>
	While reading a symbol file, GDB occasionally encounters problems, such as symbol types it does not recognize, or known bugs in compiler output. By default, GDB does not notify you of such problems, since they are relatively common and primarily of interest to people debugging compilers. If you are interested in seeing information about ill&ndash;constructed symbol tables, you can either ask GDB to print only one message about each such type of problem, no matter how many times the problem occurs; or you can ask GDB to print more messages, to see how many times the problems occur, with the set complaints command (see Optional Warnings and Messages).
</p>
<p>
	The messages currently printed, and their meanings, include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>inner block not inside outer block in symbol</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The symbol information shows where symbol scopes begin and end (such as at the start of a function or a block of statements). This error indicates that an inner scope block is not fully contained in its outer scope blocks.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB circumvents the problem by treating the inner block as if it had the same scope as the outer block. In the error message, symbol may be shown as &ldquo;(don&#039;t know)&rdquo; if the outer block is not a function.
	</p>
	<li>block at address out of order</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The symbol information for symbol scope blocks should occur in order of increasing addresses. This error indicates that it does not do so.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB does not circumvent this problem, and has trouble locating symbols in the source file whose symbols it is reading. (You can often determine what source file is affected by specifying set verbose on. See Optional Warnings and Messages.)
	</p>
	<li>bad block start address patched</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The symbol information for a symbol scope block has a start address smaller than the address of the preceding source line. This is known to occur in the SunOS 4.1.1 (and earlier) C compiler.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB circumvents the problem by treating the symbol scope block as starting on the previous source line.
	</p>
	<li>bad string table offset in symbol n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Symbol number n contains a pointer into the string table which is larger than the size of the string table.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB circumvents the problem by considering the symbol to have the name foo, which may cause other problems if many symbols end up with this name.
	</p>
	<li>unknown symbol type 0xnn</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The symbol information contains new data types that GDB does not yet know how to read. 0xnn is the symbol type of the uncomprehended information, in hexadecimal.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB circumvents the error by ignoring this symbol information. This usually allows you to debug your program, though certain symbols are not accessible. If you encounter such a problem and feel like debugging it, you can debug gdb with itself, breakpoint on complain, then go up to the function read_dbx_symtab and examine *bufp to see the symbol.
	</p>
	<li>stub type has NULL name</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB could not find the full definition for a struct or class.
	</p>
	<li>const/volatile indicator missing (ok if using g++ v1.x), got&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The symbol information for a C++ member function is missing some information that recent versions of the compiler should have output for it.
	</p>
	<li>info mismatch between compiler and debugger</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB could not parse a type specification output by the compiler.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_8edf666c" href="#TOC_HEAD_8edf666c">18.7 GDB Data Files</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB will sometimes read an auxiliary data file. These files are kept in a directory known as the data directory.
</p>
<p>
	You can set the data directory&rsquo;s name, and view the name GDB is currently using.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set data&ndash;directory directory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the directory which GDB searches for auxiliary data files to directory.
	</p>
	<li>show data&ndash;directory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the directory GDB searches for auxiliary data files.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	You can set the default data directory by using the configure&ndash;time &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;gdb&ndash;datadir&rsquo; option. If the data directory is inside GDB&rsquo;s configured binary prefix (set with &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;prefix&rsquo; or &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;exec&ndash;prefix&rsquo;), then the default data directory will be updated automatically if the installed GDB is moved to a new location.
</p>
<p>
	The data directory may also be specified with the &ndash;&ndash;data&ndash;directory command line option. See Mode Options.
</p>
	<H1><a name="HEAD_5fc798a9" href="#TOC_HEAD_5fc798a9">19 Specifying a Debugging Target</a></H1>
<p>
	A target is the execution environment occupied by your program.
</p>
<p>
	Often, GDB runs in the same host environment as your program; in that case, the debugging target is specified as a side effect when you use the file or core commands. When you need more flexibility&mdash;for example, running GDB on a physically separate host, or controlling a standalone system over a serial port or a realtime system over a TCP/IP connection&mdash;you can use the target command to specify one of the target types configured for GDB (see Commands for Managing Targets).
</p>
<p>
	It is possible to build GDB for several different target architectures. When GDB is built like that, you can choose one of the available architectures with the set architecture command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set architecture arch</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command sets the current target architecture to arch. The value of arch can be &quot;auto&quot;, in addition to one of the supported architectures.
	</p>
	<li><a name="HEAD_HIDDEN_d639e196">show architecture &nbsp;<a href="../tags/gdb-show-arch.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>gdb-show-arch</a></li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current target architecture.
	</p>
	<li>set processor</li>
	<li>processor</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These are alias commands for, respectively, set architecture and show architecture.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_49c68cbd" href="#TOC_HEAD_49c68cbd">19.1 Active Targets</a></H2>
<p>
	There are multiple classes of targets such as: processes, executable files or recording sessions. Core files belong to the process class, making core file and process mutually exclusive. Otherwise, GDB can work concurrently on multiple active targets, one in each class. This allows you to (for example) start a process and inspect its activity, while still having access to the executable file after the process finishes. Or if you start process recording (see Reverse Execution) and reverse&ndash;step there, you are presented a virtual layer of the recording target, while the process target remains stopped at the chronologically last point of the process execution.
</p>
<p>
	Use the core&ndash;file and exec&ndash;file commands to select a new core file or executable target (see Commands to Specify Files). To specify as a target a process that is already running, use the attach command (see Debugging an Already&ndash;running Process).
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_5786557f" href="#TOC_HEAD_5786557f">19.2 Commands for Managing Targets</a></H2>
<ul>
	<li>target type parameters</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Connects the GDB host environment to a target machine or process. A target is typically a protocol for talking to debugging facilities. You use the argument type to specify the type or protocol of the target machine.
	</p>
	<p>
		Further parameters are interpreted by the target protocol, but typically include things like device names or host names to connect with, process numbers, and baud rates.
	</p>
	<p>
		The target command does not repeat if you press RET again after executing the command.
	</p>
	<li>help target</li>

		Describe a particular target, including any parameters necessary to select it.
	</p>
	<li>set gnutarget args</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB uses its own library BFD to read your files. GDB knows whether it is reading an executable, a core, or a .o file; however, you can specify the file format with the set gnutarget command. Unlike most target commands, with gnutarget the target refers to a program, not a machine.
	</p>
	<pre><code>Warning: To specify a file format with set gnutarget, you must know the actual BFD name.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		See Commands to Specify Files.
	</p>
	<li>show gnutarget</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use the show gnutarget command to display what file format gnutarget is set to read. If you have not set gnutarget, GDB will determine the file format for each file automatically, and show gnutarget displays &lsquo;The current BFD target is &quot;auto&quot;&rsquo;.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Here are some common targets (available, or not, depending on the GDB configuration):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>target exec program</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		An executable file. &lsquo;target exec program&rsquo; is the same as &lsquo;exec&ndash;file program&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>target core filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		A core dump file. &lsquo;target core filename&rsquo; is the same as &lsquo;core&ndash;file filename&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>target remote medium</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		A remote system connected to GDB via a serial line or network connection. This command tells GDB to use its own remote protocol over medium for debugging. See Remote Debugging.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, if you have a board connected to /dev/ttya on the machine running GDB, you could say:
	</p>
	<pre><code>target remote /dev/ttya	</code></pre>
	<p>
		target remote supports the load command. This is only useful if you have some other way of getting the stub to the target system, and you can put it somewhere in memory where it won&rsquo;t get clobbered by the download.
	</p>
	<li>target sim [simargs] &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Builtin CPU simulator. GDB includes simulators for most architectures. In general,
	</p>
	<pre><code>target sim
load
run	</code></pre>
	<p>
		works; however, you cannot assume that a specific memory map, device drivers, or even basic I/O is available, although some simulators do provide these. For info about any processor&ndash;specific simulator details, see the appropriate section in Embedded Processors.
	</p>
	<li>target native</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Setup for local/native process debugging. Useful to make the run command spawn native processes (likewise attach, etc.) even when set auto&ndash;connect&ndash;native&ndash;target is off (see set auto&ndash;connect&ndash;native&ndash;target).
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Different targets are available on different configurations of GDB; your configuration may have more or fewer targets.
</p>
<p>
	Many remote targets require you to download the executable&rsquo;s code once you&rsquo;ve successfully established a connection. You may wish to control various aspects of this process.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set hash</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command controls whether a hash mark &lsquo;#&rsquo; is displayed while downloading a file to the remote monitor. If on, a hash mark is displayed after each S&ndash;record is successfully downloaded to the monitor.
	</p>
	<li>show hash</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current status of displaying the hash mark.
	</p>
	<li>set debug monitor</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable or disable display of communications messages between GDB and the remote monitor.
	</p>
	<li>show debug monitor</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current status of displaying communications between GDB and the remote monitor.
	</p>
	<li>load filename offset</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Depending on what remote debugging facilities are configured into GDB, the load command may be available. Where it exists, it is meant to make filename (an executable) available for debugging on the remote system&mdash;by downloading, or dynamic linking, for example. load also records the filename symbol table in GDB, like the add&ndash;symbol&ndash;file command.
	</p>
	<p>
		If your GDB does not have a load command, attempting to execute it gets the error message &ldquo;You can&#039;t do that when your target is &hellip;&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>
		The file is loaded at whatever address is specified in the executable. For some object file formats, you can specify the load address when you link the program; for other formats, like a.out, the object file format specifies a fixed address.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is also possible to tell GDB to load the executable file at a specific offset described by the optional argument offset. When offset is provided, filename must also be provided.
	</p>
	<p>
		Depending on the remote side capabilities, GDB may be able to load programs into flash memory.
	</p>
	<p>
		load does not repeat if you press RET again after using it.
	</p>
	<li>flash&ndash;erase</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Erases all known flash memory regions on the target.
	</p>
</ul>

<p>
	Some types of processors, such as the MIPS, PowerPC, and Renesas SH, offer the ability to run either big&ndash;endian or little&ndash;endian byte orders. Usually the executable or symbol will include a bit to designate the endian&ndash;ness, and you will not need to worry about which to use. However, you may still find it useful to adjust GDB&rsquo;s idea of processor endian&ndash;ness manually.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set endian big</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Instruct GDB to assume the target is big&ndash;endian.
	</p>
	<li>set endian little</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Instruct GDB to assume the target is little&ndash;endian.
	</p>
	<li>set endian auto</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Instruct GDB to use the byte order associated with the executable.
	</p>
	<li>show endian</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display GDB&rsquo;s current idea of the target byte order.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If the set endian auto mode is in effect and no executable has been selected, then the endianness used is the last one chosen either by one of the set endian big and set endian little commands or by inferring from the last executable used. If no endianness has been previously chosen, then the default for this mode is inferred from the target GDB has been built for, and is little if the name of the target CPU has an el suffix and big otherwise.
</p>
<p>
	Note that these commands merely adjust interpretation of symbolic data on the host, and that they have absolutely no effect on the target system.

<p>
	If you are trying to debug a program running on a machine that cannot run GDB in the usual way, it is often useful to use remote debugging. For example, you might use remote debugging on an operating system kernel, or on a small system which does not have a general purpose operating system powerful enough to run a full&ndash;featured debugger.
</p>
<p>
	Some configurations of GDB have special serial or TCP/IP interfaces to make this work with particular debugging targets. In addition, GDB comes with a generic serial protocol (specific to GDB, but not specific to any particular target system) which you can use if you write the remote stubs&mdash;the code that runs on the remote system to communicate with GDB.
</p>
<p>
	Other remote targets may be available in your configuration of GDB; use help target to list them.

</div>
<p>
	This section describes how to connect to a remote target, including the types of connections and their differences, how to set up executable and symbol files on the host and target, and the commands used for connecting to and disconnecting from the remote target.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_ac1620c1" href="#TOC_HEAD_ac1620c1">20.1.1 Types of Remote Connections</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB supports two types of remote connections, target remote mode and target extended&ndash;remote mode. Note that many remote targets support only target remote mode. There are several major differences between the two types of connections, enumerated here:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Result of detach or program exit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		<strong>With target remote mode:</strong> When the debugged program exits or you detach from it, GDB disconnects from the target. When using gdbserver, gdbserver will exit.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>With target extended&ndash;remote mode:</strong> When the debugged program exits or you detach from it, GDB remains connected to the target, even though no program is running. You can rerun the program, attach to a running program, or use monitor commands specific to the target.
	</p>
	<p>
		When using gdbserver in this case, it does not exit unless it was invoked using the &ndash;&ndash;once option. If the &ndash;&ndash;once option was not used, you can ask gdbserver to exit using the monitor exit command (see Monitor Commands for gdbserver).
	</p>
	<li>Specifying the program to debug</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For both connection types you use the file command to specify the program on the host system. If you are using gdbserver there are some differences in how to specify the location of the program on the target.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>With target remote mode:</strong> You must either specify the program to debug on the gdbserver command line or use the &ndash;&ndash;attach option (see Attaching to a Running Program).
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>With target extended&ndash;remote mode:</strong> You may specify the program to debug on the gdbserver command line, or you can load the program or attach to it using GDB commands after connecting to gdbserver.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can start gdbserver without supplying an initial command to run or process ID to attach. To do this, use the &ndash;&ndash;multi command line option. Then you can connect using target extended&ndash;remote and start the program you want to debug (see below for details on using the run command in this scenario). Note that the conditions under which gdbserver terminates depend on how GDB connects to it (target remote or target extended&ndash;remote). The &ndash;&ndash;multi option to gdbserver has no influence on that.
	</p>
	<li>The run command</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		<strong>With target remote mode:</strong> The run command is not supported. Once a connection has been established, you can use all the usual GDB commands to examine and change data. The remote program is already running, so you can use commands like step and continue.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>With target extended&ndash;remote mode:</strong> The run command is supported. The run command uses the value set by set remote exec&ndash;file (see set remote exec&ndash;file) to select the program to run. Command line arguments are supported, except for wildcard expansion and I/O redirection (see Arguments).
	</p>
	<p>
		If you specify the program to debug on the command line, then the run command is not required to start execution, and you can resume using commands like step and continue as with target remote mode.
	</p>
	<li>Attaching</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		<strong>With target remote mode:</strong> The GDB command attach is not supported. To attach to a running program using gdbserver, you must use the &ndash;&ndash;attach option (see Running gdbserver).
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>With target extended&ndash;remote mode:</strong> To attach to a running program, you may use the attach command after the connection has been established. If you are using gdbserver, you may also invoke gdbserver using the &ndash;&ndash;attach option (see Running gdbserver).
	</p>
	<p>
		Some remote targets allow GDB to determine the executable file running in the process the debugger is attaching to. In such a case, GDB uses the value of exec&ndash;file&ndash;mismatch to handle a possible mismatch between the executable file name running in the process and the name of the current exec&ndash;file loaded by GDB (see set exec&ndash;file&ndash;mismatch).
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_35a20e4e" href="#TOC_HEAD_35a20e4e">20.1.2 Host and Target Files</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB, running on the host, needs access to symbol and debugging information for your program running on the target. This requires access to an unstripped copy of your program, and possibly any associated symbol files. Note that this section applies equally to both target remote mode and target extended&ndash;remote mode.
</p>
<p>
	Some remote targets (see qXfer executable filename read, and see Host I/O Packets) allow GDB to access program files over the same connection used to communicate with GDB. With such a target, if the remote program is unstripped, the only command you need is target remote (or target extended&ndash;remote).
</p>
<p>
	If the remote program is stripped, or the target does not support remote program file access, start up GDB using the name of the local unstripped copy of your program as the first argument, or use the file command. Use set sysroot to specify the location (on the host) of target libraries (unless your GDB was compiled with the correct sysroot using &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;sysroot). Alternatively, you may use set solib&ndash;search&ndash;path to specify how GDB locates target libraries.
</p>
<p>
	The symbol file and target libraries must exactly match the executable and libraries on the target, with one exception: the files on the host system should not be stripped, even if the files on the target system are. Mismatched or missing files will lead to confusing results during debugging. On GNU/Linux targets, mismatched or missing files may also prevent gdbserver from debugging multi&ndash;threaded programs.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_437f192a" href="#TOC_HEAD_437f192a">20.1.3 Remote Connection Commands</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB can communicate with the target over a serial line, a local Unix domain socket, or over an IP network using TCP or UDP. In each case, GDB uses the same protocol for debugging your program; only the medium carrying the debugging packets varies. The target remote and target extended&ndash;remote commands establish a connection to the target. Both commands accept the same arguments, which indicate the medium to use:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>target remote serial&ndash;device</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote serial&ndash;device</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use serial&ndash;device to communicate with the target. For example, to use a serial line connected to the device named /dev/ttyb:
	</p>
	<pre><code>target remote /dev/ttyb	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If you&rsquo;re using a serial line, you may want to give GDB the &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;baud&rsquo; option, or use the set serial baud command (see set serial baud) before the target command.
	</p>
	<li>target remote local&ndash;socket</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote local&ndash;socket</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use local&ndash;socket to communicate with the target. For example, to use a local Unix domain socket bound to the file system entry /tmp/gdb&ndash;socket0:
	</p>
	<pre><code>target remote /tmp/gdb-socket0	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note that this command has the same form as the command to connect to a serial line. GDB will automatically determine which kind of file you have specified and will make the appropriate kind of connection. This feature is not available if the host system does not support Unix domain sockets.
	</p>
	<li>target remote host:port</li>
	<li>target remote [host]:port</li>
	<li>target remote tcp:host:port</li>
	<li>target remote tcp:[host]:port</li>
	<li>target remote tcp4:host:port</li>
	<li>target remote tcp6:host:port</li>
	<li>target remote tcp6:[host]:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote host:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote [host]:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote tcp:host:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote tcp:[host]:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote tcp4:host:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote tcp6:host:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote tcp6:[host]:port</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Debug using a TCP connection to port on host. The host may be either a host name, a numeric IPv4 address, or a numeric IPv6 address (with or without the square brackets to separate the address from the port); port must be a decimal number. The host could be the target machine itself, if it is directly connected to the net, or it might be a terminal server which in turn has a serial line to the target.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, to connect to port 2828 on a terminal server named manyfarms:
	</p>
	<pre><code>target remote manyfarms:2828	</code></pre>
	<p>
		To connect to port 2828 on a terminal server whose address is 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, you can either use the square bracket syntax:
	</p>
	<pre><code>target remote [2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]:2828	</code></pre>
	<p>
		or explicitly specify the IPv6 protocol:
	</p>
	<pre><code>target remote tcp6:2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334:2828	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This last example may be confusing to the reader, because there is no visible separation between the hostname and the port number. Therefore, we recommend the user to provide IPv6 addresses using square brackets for clarity. However, it is important to mention that for GDB there is no ambiguity: the number after the last colon is considered to be the port number.
	</p>
	<p>
		If your remote target is actually running on the same machine as your debugger session (e.g. a simulator for your target running on the same host), you can omit the hostname. For example, to connect to port 1234 on your local machine:
	</p>
	<pre><code>target remote :1234	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note that the colon is still required here.
	</p>
	<li>target remote udp:host:port</li>
	<li>target remote udp:[host]:port</li>
	<li>target remote udp4:host:port</li>
	<li>target remote udp6:[host]:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote udp:host:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote udp:host:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote udp:[host]:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote udp4:host:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote udp6:host:port</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote udp6:[host]:port</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Debug using UDP packets to port on host. For example, to connect to UDP port 2828 on a terminal server named manyfarms:
	</p>
	<pre><code>target remote udp:manyfarms:2828	</code></pre>
	<p>
		When using a UDP connection for remote debugging, you should keep in mind that the &lsquo;U&rsquo; stands for &ldquo;Unreliable&rdquo;. UDP can silently drop packets on busy or unreliable networks, which will cause havoc with your debugging session.
	</p>
	<li>target remote | command</li>
	<li>target extended&ndash;remote | command</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Run command in the background and communicate with it using a pipe. The command is a shell command, to be parsed and expanded by the system&rsquo;s command shell, /bin/sh; it should expect remote protocol packets on its standard input, and send replies on its standard output. You could use this to run a stand&ndash;alone simulator that speaks the remote debugging protocol, to make net connections using programs like ssh, or for other similar tricks.
	</p>
	<p>
		If command closes its standard output (perhaps by exiting), GDB will try to send it a SIGTERM signal. (If the program has already exited, this will have no effect.)
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Whenever GDB is waiting for the remote program, if you type the interrupt character (often Ctrl&ndash;c), GDB attempts to stop the program. This may or may not succeed, depending in part on the hardware and the serial drivers the remote system uses. If you type the interrupt character once again, GDB displays this prompt:
</p>
<pre><code>Interrupted while waiting for the program.
Give up (and stop debugging it)?  (y or n)</code></pre>
<p>
	In target remote mode, if you type y, GDB abandons the remote debugging session. (If you decide you want to try again later, you can use target remote again to connect once more.) If you type n, GDB goes back to waiting.
</p>
<p>
	In target extended&ndash;remote mode, typing n will leave GDB connected to the target.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>detach</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When you have finished debugging the remote program, you can use the detach command to release it from GDB control. Detaching from the target normally resumes its execution, but the results will depend on your particular remote stub. After the detach command in target remote mode, GDB is free to connect to another target. In target extended&ndash;remote mode, GDB is still connected to the target.
	</p>
	<li>disconnect</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The disconnect command closes the connection to the target, and the target is generally not resumed. It will wait for GDB (this instance or another one) to connect and continue debugging. After the disconnect command, GDB is again free to connect to another target.
	</p>
	<li>monitor cmd</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command allows you to send arbitrary commands directly to the remote monitor. Since GDB doesn&rsquo;t care about the commands it sends like this, this command is the way to extend GDB&mdash;you can add new commands that only the external monitor will understand and implement.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_44a61c72" href="#TOC_HEAD_44a61c72">20.2 Sending files to a remote system</a></H2>
<p>
	Some remote targets offer the ability to transfer files over the same connection used to communicate with GDB. This is convenient for targets accessible through other means, e.g. GNU/Linux systems running gdbserver over a network interface. For other targets, e.g. embedded devices with only a single serial port, this may be the only way to upload or download files.
</p>
<p>
	Not all remote targets support these commands.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>remote put hostfile targetfile</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Copy file hostfile from the host system (the machine running GDB) to targetfile on the target system.
	</p>
	<li>remote get targetfile hostfile</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Copy file targetfile from the target system to hostfile on the host system.
	</p>

	<p>
		Delete targetfile from the target system.

<p>
	gdbserver is a control program for Unix&ndash;like systems, which allows you to connect your program with a remote GDB via target remote or target extended&ndash;remote&mdash;but without linking in the usual debugging stub.
</p>
<p>
	gdbserver is not a complete replacement for the debugging stubs, because it requires essentially the same operating&ndash;system facilities that GDB itself does. In fact, a system that can run gdbserver to connect to a remote GDB could also run GDB locally! gdbserver is sometimes useful nevertheless, because it is a much smaller program than GDB itself. It is also easier to port than all of GDB, so you may be able to get started more quickly on a new system by using gdbserver. Finally, if you develop code for real&ndash;time systems, you may find that the tradeoffs involved in real&ndash;time operation make it more convenient to do as much development work as possible on another system, for example by cross&ndash;compiling. You can use gdbserver to make a similar choice for debugging.
</p>
<p>
	GDB and gdbserver communicate via either a serial line or a TCP connection, using the standard GDB remote serial protocol.
</p>
<pre><code>Warning: gdbserver does not have any built-in security. Do not run gdbserver connected to any public network; a GDB connection to gdbserver provides access to the target system with the same privileges as the user running gdbserver.</code></pre>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_cf98394d" href="#TOC_HEAD_cf98394d">20.3.1 Running gdbserver</a></H3>
<p>
	Run gdbserver on the target system. You need a copy of the program you want to debug, including any libraries it requires. gdbserver does not need your program&rsquo;s symbol table, so you can strip the program if necessary to save space. GDB on the host system does all the symbol handling.
</p>
<p>
	To use the server, you must tell it how to communicate with GDB; the name of your program; and the arguments for your program. The usual syntax is:
</p>
<pre><code>target&gt; gdbserver comm program [ args … ]</code></pre>
<p>
	comm is either a device name (to use a serial line), or a TCP hostname and portnumber, or &ndash; or stdio to use stdin/stdout of gdbserver. For example, to debug Emacs with the argument &lsquo;foo.txt&rsquo; and communicate with GDB over the serial port /dev/com1:
</p>
<pre><code>target&gt; gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt</code></pre>
<p>
	gdbserver waits passively for the host GDB to communicate with it.
</p>
<p>
	To use a TCP connection instead of a serial line:
</p>
<pre><code>target&gt; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt</code></pre>
<p>
	The only difference from the previous example is the first argument, specifying that you are communicating with the host GDB via TCP. The &lsquo;host:2345&rsquo; argument means that gdbserver is to expect a TCP connection from machine &lsquo;host&rsquo; to local TCP port 2345. (Currently, the &lsquo;host&rsquo; part is ignored.) You can choose any number you want for the port number as long as it does not conflict with any TCP ports already in use on the target system (for example, 23 is reserved for telnet).16 You must use the same port number with the host GDB target remote command.
</p>
<p>
	The stdio connection is useful when starting gdbserver with ssh:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) target remote | ssh -T hostname gdbserver - hello</code></pre>
<p>
	The &lsquo;&ndash;T&rsquo; option to ssh is provided because we don&rsquo;t need a remote pty, and we don&rsquo;t want escape&ndash;character handling. Ssh does this by default when a command is provided, the flag is provided to make it explicit. You could elide it if you want to.
</p>
<p>
	Programs started with stdio&ndash;connected gdbserver have /dev/null for stdin, and stdout,stderr are sent back to gdb for display through a pipe connected to gdbserver. Both stdout and stderr use the same pipe.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_3b5f6d9" href="#TOC_HEAD_3b5f6d9">20.3.1.1 Attaching to a Running Program</a></H4>
<p>
	On some targets, gdbserver can also attach to running programs. This is accomplished via the &ndash;&ndash;attach argument. The syntax is:
</p>
<pre><code>target&gt; gdbserver --attach comm pid</code></pre>
<p>
	pid is the process ID of a currently running process. It isn&rsquo;t necessary to point gdbserver at a binary for the running process.
</p>
<p>
	In target extended&ndash;remote mode, you can also attach using the GDB attach command (see Attaching in Types of Remote Connections).
</p>
<p>
	You can debug processes by name instead of process ID if your target has the pidof utility:
</p>
<pre><code>target&gt; gdbserver --attach comm `pidof program`</code></pre>
<p>
	In case more than one copy of program is running, or program has multiple threads, most versions of pidof support the &ndash;s option to only return the first process ID.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_da55954b" href="#TOC_HEAD_da55954b">20.3.1.2 TCP port allocation lifecycle of gdbserver</a></H4>
<p>
	This section applies only when gdbserver is run to listen on a TCP port.
</p>
<p>
	gdbserver normally terminates after all of its debugged processes have terminated in target remote mode. On the other hand, for target extended&ndash;remote, gdbserver stays running even with no processes left. GDB normally terminates the spawned debugged process on its exit, which normally also terminates gdbserver in the target remote mode. Therefore, when the connection drops unexpectedly, and GDB cannot ask gdbserver to kill its debugged processes, gdbserver stays running even in the target remote mode.
</p>
<p>
	When gdbserver stays running, GDB can connect to it again later. Such reconnecting is useful for features like disconnected tracing. For completeness, at most one GDB can be connected at a time.
</p>
<p>
	By default, gdbserver keeps the listening TCP port open, so that subsequent connections are possible. However, if you start gdbserver with the &ndash;&ndash;once option, it will stop listening for any further connection attempts after connecting to the first GDB session. This means no further connections to gdbserver will be possible after the first one. It also means gdbserver will terminate after the first connection with remote GDB has closed, even for unexpectedly closed connections and even in the target extended&ndash;remote mode. The &ndash;&ndash;once option allows reusing the same port number for connecting to multiple instances of gdbserver running on the same host, since each instance closes its port after the first connection.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_3dd996a2" href="#TOC_HEAD_3dd996a2">20.3.1.3 Other Command&ndash;Line Arguments for gdbserver</a></H4>
<p>
	You can use the &ndash;&ndash;multi option to start gdbserver without specifying a program to debug or a process to attach to. Then you can attach in target extended&ndash;remote mode and run or attach to a program. For more information, see &ndash;&ndash;multi Option in Types of Remote Connnections.
</p>
<p>
	The &ndash;&ndash;debug option tells gdbserver to display extra status information about the debugging process. The &ndash;&ndash;remote&ndash;debug option tells gdbserver to display remote protocol debug output. The &ndash;&ndash;debug&ndash;file=filename option tells gdbserver to write any debug output to the given filename. These options are intended for gdbserver development and for bug reports to the developers.
</p>
<p>
	The &ndash;&ndash;debug&ndash;format=option1[,option2,...] option tells gdbserver to include additional information in each output. Possible options are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>none</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Turn off all extra information in debugging output.
	</p>
	<li>all</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Turn on all extra information in debugging output.
	</p>
	<li>timestamps</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Include a timestamp in each line of debugging output.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Options are processed in order. Thus, for example, if none appears last then no additional information is added to debugging output.
</p>
<p>
	The &ndash;&ndash;wrapper option specifies a wrapper to launch programs for debugging. The option should be followed by the name of the wrapper, then any command&ndash;line arguments to pass to the wrapper, then &ndash;&ndash; indicating the end of the wrapper arguments.
</p>
<p>
	gdbserver runs the specified wrapper program with a combined command line including the wrapper arguments, then the name of the program to debug, then any arguments to the program. The wrapper runs until it executes your program, and then GDB gains control.
</p>
<p>
	You can use any program that eventually calls execve with its arguments as a wrapper. Several standard Unix utilities do this, e.g. env and nohup. Any Unix shell script ending with exec &quot;$@&quot; will also work.
</p>
<p>
	For example, you can use env to pass an environment variable to the debugged program, without setting the variable in gdbserver&rsquo;s environment:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdbserver --wrapper env LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so -- :2222 ./testprog</code></pre>
<p>
	The &ndash;&ndash;selftest option runs the self tests in gdbserver:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdbserver --selftest
Ran 2 unit tests, 0 failed</code></pre>
<p>
	These tests are disabled in release.

	<H3><a name="HEAD_4a2053f2" href="#TOC_HEAD_4a2053f2">20.3.2 Connecting to gdbserver</a></H3>
<p>
	The basic procedure for connecting to the remote target is:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Run GDB on the host system.</li>
	<li>Make sure you have the necessary symbol files (see Host and target files). Load symbols for your application using the file command before you connect. Use set sysroot to locate target libraries (unless your GDB was compiled with the correct sysroot using &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;sysroot).</li>
	<li>Connect to your target (see Connecting to a Remote Target). For TCP connections, you must start up gdbserver prior to using the target command. Otherwise you may get an error whose text depends on the host system, but which usually looks something like &lsquo;Connection refused&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t use the load command in GDB when using target remote mode, since the program is already on the target.</li>

	<H3><a name="HEAD_988977d7" href="#TOC_HEAD_988977d7">20.3.3 Monitor Commands for gdbserver</a></H3>
<p>
	During a GDB session using gdbserver, you can use the monitor command to send special requests to gdbserver. Here are the available commands.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>monitor help</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		List the available monitor commands.
	</p>
	<li>monitor set debug 0</li>
	<li>monitor set debug 1</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable or enable general debugging messages.
	</p>
	<li>monitor set remote&ndash;debug 0</li>
	<li>monitor set remote&ndash;debug 1</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable or enable specific debugging messages associated with the remote protocol (see Remote Protocol).
	</p>
	<li>monitor set debug&ndash;file filename</li>
	<li>monitor set debug&ndash;file</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Send any debug output to the given file, or to stderr.
	</p>
	<li>monitor set debug&ndash;format option1[,option2,...]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specify additional text to add to debugging messages. Possible options are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>none</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Turn off all extra information in debugging output.
		</p>
		<li>all</li>

		<li>Options are processed in order. Thus, for example, if none appears last then no additional information is added to debugging output.</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<li>monitor set libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path [PATH]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When this command is issued, path is a colon&ndash;separated list of directories to search for libthread_db (see set libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path). If you omit path, &lsquo;libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; will be reset to its default value.
	</p>
	<p>
		The special entry &lsquo;$pdir&rsquo; for &lsquo;libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; is not supported in gdbserver.
	</p>
	<li>monitor exit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell gdbserver to exit immediately. This command should be followed by disconnect to close the debugging session. gdbserver will detach from any attached processes and kill any processes it created. Use monitor exit to terminate gdbserver at the end of a multi&ndash;process mode debug session.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_5369fcad" href="#TOC_HEAD_5369fcad">20.3.4 Tracepoints support in gdbserver</a></H3>
<p>
	On some targets, gdbserver supports tracepoints, fast tracepoints and static tracepoints.
</p>
<p>
	For fast or static tracepoints to work, a special library called the in&ndash;process agent (IPA), must be loaded in the inferior process. This library is built and distributed as an integral part of gdbserver. In addition, support for static tracepoints requires building the in&ndash;process agent library with static tracepoints support. At present, the UST (LTTng Userspace Tracer, http://lttng.org/ust) tracing engine is supported. This support is automatically available if UST development headers are found in the standard include path when gdbserver is built, or if gdbserver was explicitly configured using &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;ust to point at such headers. You can explicitly disable the support using &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;ust=no.
</p>
<p>
	There are several ways to load the in&ndash;process agent in your program:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Specifying it as dependency at link time</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		You can link your program dynamically with the in&ndash;process agent library. On most systems, this is accomplished by adding &ndash;linproctrace to the link command.
	</p>
	<li>Using the system&#039;s preloading mechanisms</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		You can force loading the in&ndash;process agent at startup time by using your system&rsquo;s support for preloading shared libraries. Many Unixes support the concept of preloading user defined libraries. In most cases, you do that by specifying LD_PRELOAD=libinproctrace.so in the environment. See also the description of gdbserver&rsquo;s &ndash;&ndash;wrapper command line option.
	</p>
	<li>Using GDB to force loading the agent at run time</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		On some systems, you can force the inferior to load a shared library, by calling a dynamic loader function in the inferior that takes care of dynamically looking up and loading a shared library. On most Unix systems, the function is dlopen. You&rsquo;ll use the call command for that. For example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) call dlopen ("libinproctrace.so", ...)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note that on most Unix systems, for the dlopen function to be available, the program needs to be linked with &ndash;ldl.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	On systems that have a userspace dynamic loader, like most Unix systems, when you connect to gdbserver using target remote, you&rsquo;ll find that the program is stopped at the dynamic loader&rsquo;s entry point, and no shared library has been loaded in the program&rsquo;s address space yet, including the in&ndash;process agent. In that case, before being able to use any of the fast or static tracepoints features, you need to let the loader run and load the shared libraries. The simplest way to do that is to run the program to the main procedure. E.g., if debugging a C or C++ program, start gdbserver like so:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdbserver :9999 myprogram</code></pre>
<p>
	Start GDB and connect to gdbserver like so, and run to main:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb myprogram
(gdb) target remote myhost:9999
0x00007f215893ba60 in ?? () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
(gdb) b main
(gdb) continue</code></pre>
<p>
	The in&ndash;process tracing agent library should now be loaded into the process; you can confirm it with the info sharedlibrary command, which will list libinproctrace.so as loaded in the process. You are now ready to install fast tracepoints, list static tracepoint markers, probe static tracepoints markers, and start tracing.

<p>
	This section documents the configuration options available when debugging remote programs. For the options related to the File I/O extensions of the remote protocol, see system&ndash;call&ndash;allowed.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set remoteaddresssize bits</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the maximum size of address in a memory packet to the specified number of bits. GDB will mask off the address bits above that number, when it passes addresses to the remote target. The default value is the number of bits in the target&rsquo;s address.
	</p>
	<li>show remoteaddresssize</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current value of remote address size in bits.
	</p>
	<li>set serial baud n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the baud rate for the remote serial I/O to n baud. The value is used to set the speed of the serial port used for debugging remote targets.
	</p>
	<li>show serial baud</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current speed of the remote connection.
	</p>
	<li>set serial parity parity</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the parity for the remote serial I/O. Supported values of parity are: even, none, and odd. The default is none.
	</p>
	<li>show serial parity</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current parity of the serial port.
	</p>
	<li>set remotebreak</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If set to on, GDB sends a BREAK signal to the remote when you type Ctrl&ndash;c to interrupt the program running on the remote. If set to off, GDB sends the &lsquo;Ctrl&ndash;C&rsquo; character instead. The default is off, since most remote systems expect to see &lsquo;Ctrl&ndash;C&rsquo; as the interrupt signal.
	</p>
	<li>show remotebreak</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether GDB sends BREAK or &lsquo;Ctrl&ndash;C&rsquo; to interrupt the remote program.
	</p>
	<li>set remoteflow on</li>
	<li>set remoteflow off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable or disable hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) on the serial port used to communicate to the remote target.
	</p>
	<li>show remoteflow</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of hardware flow control.
	</p>
	<li>set remotelogbase base</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the base (a.k.a. radix) of logging serial protocol communications to base. Supported values of base are: ascii, octal, and hex. The default is ascii.
	</p>
	<li>show remotelogbase</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of the radix for logging remote serial protocol.
	</p>
	<li>set remotelogfile file</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Record remote serial communications on the named file. The default is not to record at all.
	</p>
	<li>show remotelogfile</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of the file name on which to record the serial communications.
	</p>
	<li>set remotetimeout num</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the timeout limit to wait for the remote target to respond to num seconds. The default is 2 seconds.
	</p>
	<li>show remotetimeout</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current number of seconds to wait for the remote target responses.
	</p>
	<li>set remote hardware&ndash;watchpoint&ndash;limit limit</li>
	<li>set remote hardware&ndash;breakpoint&ndash;limit limit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Restrict GDB to using limit remote hardware watchpoints or breakpoints. The limit can be set to 0 to disable hardware watchpoints or breakpoints, and unlimited for unlimited watchpoints or breakpoints.
	</p>
	<li>show remote hardware&ndash;watchpoint&ndash;limit</li>
	<li>show remote hardware&ndash;breakpoint&ndash;limit</li>

	</p>
	<li>set remote hardware&ndash;watchpoint&ndash;length&ndash;limit limit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Restrict GDB to using limit bytes for the maximum length of a remote hardware watchpoint. A limit of 0 disables hardware watchpoints and unlimited allows watchpoints of any length.
	</p>
	<li>show remote hardware&ndash;watchpoint&ndash;length&ndash;limit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current limit (in bytes) of the maximum length of a remote hardware watchpoint.
	</p>
	<li>set remote exec&ndash;file filename</li>
	<li>show remote exec&ndash;file</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Select the file used for run with target extended&ndash;remote. This should be set to a filename valid on the target system. If it is not set, the target will use a default filename (e.g. the last program run).
	</p>
	<li>set remote interrupt&ndash;sequence</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Allow the user to select one of &lsquo;Ctrl&ndash;C&rsquo;, a BREAK or &lsquo;BREAK&ndash;g&rsquo; as the sequence to the remote target in order to interrupt the execution. &lsquo;Ctrl&ndash;C&rsquo; is a default. Some system prefers BREAK which is high level of serial line for some certain time. Linux kernel prefers &lsquo;BREAK&ndash;g&rsquo;, a.k.a Magic SysRq g. It is BREAK signal followed by character g.
	</p>
	<li>show remote interrupt&ndash;sequence</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show which of &lsquo;Ctrl&ndash;C&rsquo;, BREAK or BREAK&ndash;g is sent by GDB to interrupt the remote program. BREAK&ndash;g is BREAK signal followed by g and also known as Magic SysRq g.
	</p>
	<li>set remote interrupt&ndash;on&ndash;connect</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specify whether interrupt&ndash;sequence is sent to remote target when GDB connects to it. This is mostly needed when you debug Linux kernel. Linux kernel expects BREAK followed by g which is known as Magic SysRq g in order to connect GDB.
	</p>
	<li>show remote interrupt&ndash;on&ndash;connect</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether interrupt&ndash;sequence is sent to remote target when GDB connects to it.
	</p>
	<li>set tcp auto&ndash;retry on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable auto&ndash;retry for remote TCP connections. This is useful if the remote debugging agent is launched in parallel with GDB; there is a race condition because the agent may not become ready to accept the connection before GDB attempts to connect. When auto&ndash;retry is enabled, if the initial attempt to connect fails, GDB reattempts to establish the connection using the timeout specified by set tcp connect&ndash;timeout.
	</p>
	<li>set tcp auto&ndash;retry off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Do not auto&ndash;retry failed TCP connections.
	</p>
	<li>show tcp auto&ndash;retry</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current auto&ndash;retry setting.
	</p>
	<li>set tcp connect&ndash;timeout seconds</li>
	<li>set tcp connect&ndash;timeout unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the timeout for establishing a TCP connection to the remote target to seconds. The timeout affects both polling to retry failed connections (enabled by set tcp auto&ndash;retry on) and waiting for connections that are merely slow to complete, and represents an approximate cumulative value. If seconds is unlimited, there is no timeout and GDB will keep attempting to establish a connection forever, unless interrupted with Ctrl&ndash;c. The default is 15 seconds.
	</p>
	<li>show tcp connect&ndash;timeout</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current connection timeout setting.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The GDB remote protocol autodetects the packets supported by your debugging stub. If you need to override the autodetection, you can use these commands to enable or disable individual packets. Each packet can be set to &lsquo;on&rsquo; (the remote target supports this packet), &lsquo;off&rsquo; (the remote target does not support this packet), or &lsquo;auto&rsquo; (detect remote target support for this packet). They all default to &lsquo;auto&rsquo;. For more information about each packet, see Remote Protocol.
</p>
<p>
	During normal use, you should not have to use any of these commands. If you do, that may be a bug in your remote debugging stub, or a bug in GDB. You may want to report the problem to the GDB developers.
</p>
<p>
	For each packet name, the command to enable or disable the packet is set remote name&ndash;packet. If you configure a packet, the configuration will apply for all future remote targets if no target is selected. In case there is a target selected, only the configuration of the current target is changed. All other existing remote targets&rsquo; features are not affected. The command to print the current configuration of a packet is show remote name&ndash;packet. It displays the current remote target&rsquo;s configuration. If no remote target is selected, the default configuration for future connections is shown. The available settings are:

	The number of bytes per memory&ndash;read or memory&ndash;write packet for a remote target can be configured using the commands set remote memory&ndash;read&ndash;packet&ndash;size and set remote memory&ndash;write&ndash;packet&ndash;size. If set to &lsquo;0&rsquo; (zero) the default packet size will be used. The actual limit is further reduced depending on the target. Specify &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; to disable the target&ndash;dependent restriction and &lsquo;limit&rsquo; to enable it. Similar to the enabling and disabling of remote packets, the command applies to the currently selected target (if available). If no remote target is selected, it applies to all future remote connections. The configuration of the selected target can be displayed using the commands show remote memory&ndash;read&ndash;packet&ndash;size and show remote memory&ndash;write&ndash;packet&ndash;size. If no remote target is selected, the default configuration for future connections is shown.

<p>
	The stub files provided with GDB implement the target side of the communication protocol, and the GDB side is implemented in the GDB source file remote.c. Normally, you can simply allow these subroutines to communicate, and ignore the details. (If you&rsquo;re implementing your own stub file, you can still ignore the details: start with one of the existing stub files. sparc&ndash;stub.c is the best organized, and therefore the easiest to read.)
</p>
<p>
	To debug a program running on another machine (the debugging target machine), you must first arrange for all the usual prerequisites for the program to run by itself. For example, for a C program, you need:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>A startup routine to set up the C runtime environment; these usually have a name like crt0. The startup routine may be supplied by your hardware supplier, or you may have to write your own.</li>
	<li>A C subroutine library to support your program&rsquo;s subroutine calls, notably managing input and output.</li>
	<li>A way of getting your program to the other machine&mdash;for example, a download program. These are often supplied by the hardware manufacturer, but you may have to write your own from hardware documentation.</li>
	<br />
</ol>
<p>
	The next step is to arrange for your program to use a serial port to communicate with the machine where GDB is running (the host machine). In general terms, the scheme looks like this:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>On the host,</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB already understands how to use this protocol; when everything else is set up, you can simply use the &lsquo;target remote&rsquo; command (see Specifying a Debugging Target).
	</p>
	<li>On the target,</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		you must link with your program a few special&ndash;purpose subroutines that implement the GDB remote serial protocol. The file containing these subroutines is called a debugging stub.
	</p>
	<p>
		On certain remote targets, you can use an auxiliary program gdbserver instead of linking a stub into your program. See Using the gdbserver Program, for details.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The debugging stub is specific to the architecture of the remote machine; for example, use sparc&ndash;stub.c to debug programs on SPARC boards.
</p>
<p>
	These working remote stubs are distributed with GDB:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>i386&ndash;stub.c</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For Intel 386 and compatible architectures.
	</p>
	<li>m68k&ndash;stub.c</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For Motorola 680x0 architectures.
	</p>
	<li>sh&ndash;stub.c</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For Renesas SH architectures.
	</p>
	<li>sparc&ndash;stub.c</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For SPARC architectures.
	</p>
	<li>sparcl&ndash;stub.c</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For Fujitsu SPARCLITE architectures.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The README file in the GDB distribution may list other recently added stub
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_6e5a4262" href="#TOC_HEAD_6e5a4262">20.5.1 What the Stub Can Do for You</a></H3>
<p>
	The debugging stub for your architecture supplies these three subroutines:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set_debug_traps</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This routine arranges for handle_exception to run when your program stops. You must call this subroutine explicitly in your program&rsquo;s startup code.
	</p>
	<li>handle_exception</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is the central workhorse, but your program never calls it explicitly&mdash;the setup code arranges for handle_exception to run when a trap is triggered.
	</p>
	<p>
		handle_exception takes control when your program stops during execution (for example, on a breakpoint), and mediates communications with GDB on the host machine. This is where the communications protocol is implemented; handle_exception acts as the GDB representative on the target machine. It begins by sending summary information on the state of your program, then continues to execute, retrieving and transmitting any information GDB needs, until you execute a GDB command that makes your program resume; at that point, handle_exception returns control to your own code on the target machine.
	</p>
	<li>breakpoint</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use this auxiliary subroutine to make your program contain a breakpoint. Depending on the particular situation, this may be the only way for GDB to get control. For instance, if your target machine has some sort of interrupt button, you won&rsquo;t need to call this; pressing the interrupt button transfers control to handle_exception&mdash;in effect, to GDB. On some machines, simply receiving characters on the serial port may also trigger a trap; again, in that situation, you don&rsquo;t need to call breakpoint from your own program&mdash;simply running &lsquo;target remote&rsquo; from the host GDB session gets control.
	</p>
	<p>
		Call breakpoint if none of these is true, or if you simply want to make certain your program stops at a predetermined point for the start of your debugging session.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_f7ce0458" href="#TOC_HEAD_f7ce0458">20.5.2 What You Must Do for the Stub</a></H3>
<p>
	The debugging stubs that come with GDB are set up for a particular chip architecture, but they have no information about the rest of your debugging target machine.
</p>
<p>
	First of all you need to tell the stub how to communicate with the serial port.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>int getDebugChar()</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Write this subroutine to read a single character from the serial port. It may be identical to getchar for your target system; a different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish.
	</p>
	<li>void putDebugChar(int)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Write this subroutine to write a single character to the serial port. It may be identical to putchar for your target system; a different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If you want GDB to be able to stop your program while it is running, you need to use an interrupt&ndash;driven serial driver, and arrange for it to stop when it receives a &circ;C (&lsquo;\003&rsquo;, the control&ndash;C character). That is the character which GDB uses to tell the remote system to stop.
</p>
<p>
	Getting the debugging target to return the proper status to GDB probably requires changes to the standard stub; one quick and dirty way is to just execute a breakpoint instruction (the &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; part is that GDB reports a SIGTRAP instead of a SIGINT).
</p>
<p>
	Other routines you need to supply are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>void exceptionHandler (int exception_number, void *exception_address)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Write this function to install exception_address in the exception handling tables. You need to do this because the stub does not have any way of knowing what the exception handling tables on your target system are like (for example, the processor&rsquo;s table might be in ROM, containing entries which point to a table in RAM). The exception_number specifies the exception which should be changed; its meaning is architecture&ndash;dependent (for example, different numbers might represent divide by zero, misaligned access, etc). When this exception occurs, control should be transferred directly to exception_address, and the processor state (stack, registers, and so on) should be just as it is when a processor exception occurs. So if you want to use a jump instruction to reach exception_address, it should be a simple jump, not a jump to subroutine.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the 386, exception_address should be installed as an interrupt gate so that interrupts are masked while the handler runs. The gate should be at privilege level 0 (the most privileged level). The SPARC and 68k stubs are able to mask interrupts themselves without help from exceptionHandler.
	</p>
	<li>void flush_i_cache()</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		On SPARC and SPARCLITE only, write this subroutine to flush the instruction cache, if any, on your target machine. If there is no instruction cache, this subroutine may be a no&ndash;op.
	</p>
	<p>
		On target machines that have instruction caches, GDB requires this function to make certain that the state of your program is stable.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	You must also make sure this library routine is available:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>void *memset(void *, int, int)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is the standard library function memset that sets an area of memory to a known value. If you have one of the free versions of libc.a, memset can be found there; otherwise, you must either obtain it from your hardware manufacturer, or write your own.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If you do not use the GNU C compiler, you may need other standard library subroutines as well; this varies from one stub to another, but in general the stubs are likely to use any of the common library subroutines which GCC generates as inline code.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_17901215" href="#TOC_HEAD_17901215">20.5.3 Putting it All Together</a></H3>
<p>
	In summary, when your program is ready to debug, you must follow these steps.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure you have defined the supporting low&ndash;level routines (see What You Must Do for the Stub):</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>getDebugChar, putDebugChar,
flush_i_cache, memset, exceptionHandler.	</code></pre>
	<li>Insert these lines in your program&rsquo;s startup code, before the main procedure is called:</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>set_debug_traps();
breakpoint();	</code></pre>
	<p>
		On some machines, when a breakpoint trap is raised, the hardware automatically makes the PC point to the instruction after the breakpoint. If your machine doesn&rsquo;t do that, you may need to adjust handle_exception to arrange for it to return to the instruction after the breakpoint on this first invocation, so that your program doesn&rsquo;t keep hitting the initial breakpoint instead of making progress.
	</p>
	<li>For the 680x0 stub only, you need to provide a variable called exceptionHook. Normally you just use:</li>
	<br />
	<pre><code>void (*exceptionHook)() = 0;	</code></pre>
	<p>
		but if before calling set_debug_traps, you set it to point to a function in your program, that function is called when GDB continues after stopping on a trap (for example, bus error). The function indicated by exceptionHook is called with one parameter: an int which is the exception number.
	</p>
	<li>Compile and link together: your program, the GDB debugging stub for your target architecture, and the supporting subroutines.</li>
	<li>Make sure you have a serial connection between your target machine and the GDB host, and identify the serial port on the host.</li>
	<li>Download your program to your target machine (or get it there by whatever means the manufacturer provides), and start it.</li>
	<li>Start GDB on the host, and connect to the target (see Connecting to a Remote Target).</li>

<p>
	While nearly all GDB commands are available for all native and cross versions of the debugger, there are some exceptions. This chapter describes things that are only available in certain configurations.
</p>
<p>
	There are three major categories of configurations: native configurations, where the host and target are the same, embedded operating system configurations, which are usually the same for several different processor architectures, and bare embedded processors, which are quite different from each other.

</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_1f07329e" href="#TOC_HEAD_1f07329e">21.1.1 BSD libkvm Interface</a></H3>
<p>
	BSD&ndash;derived systems (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD) have a kernel memory interface that provides a uniform interface for accessing kernel virtual memory images, including live systems and crash dumps. GDB uses this interface to allow you to debug live kernels and kernel crash dumps on many native BSD configurations. This is implemented as a special kvm debugging target. For debugging a live system, load the currently running kernel into GDB and connect to the kvm target:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) target kvm</code></pre>
<p>
	For debugging crash dumps, provide the file name of the crash dump as an argument:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) target kvm /var/crash/bsd.0</code></pre>
<p>
	Once connected to the kvm target, the following commands are available:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>kvm pcb</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set current context from the Process Control Block (PCB) address.
	</p>
	<li>kvm proc</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set current context from proc address. This command isn&rsquo;t available on modern FreeBSD systems.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_9ce1c321" href="#TOC_HEAD_9ce1c321">21.1.2 Process Information</a></H3>
<p>
	Some operating systems provide interfaces to fetch additional information about running processes beyond memory and per&ndash;thread register state. If GDB is configured for an operating system with a supported interface, the command info proc is available to report information about the process running your program, or about any process running on your system.
</p>
<p>
	One supported interface is a facility called &lsquo;/proc&rsquo; that can be used to examine the image of a running process using file&ndash;system subroutines. This facility is supported on GNU/Linux and Solaris systems.
</p>
<p>
	On FreeBSD and NetBSD systems, system control nodes are used to query process information.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, some systems may provide additional process information in core files. Note that a core file may include a subset of the information available from a live process. Process information is currently available from cores created on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD systems.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info proc</li>
	<li>info proc process&ndash;id</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Summarize available information about a process. If a process ID is specified by process&ndash;id, display information about that process; otherwise display information about the program being debugged. The summary includes the debugged process ID, the command line used to invoke it, its current working directory, and its executable file&rsquo;s absolute file name.
	</p>
	<p>
		On some systems, process&ndash;id can be of the form &lsquo;[pid]/tid&rsquo; which specifies a certain thread ID within a process. If the optional pid part is missing, it means a thread from the process being debugged (the leading &lsquo;/&rsquo; still needs to be present, or else GDB will interpret the number as a process ID rather than a thread ID).
	</p>
	<li>info proc cmdline</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the original command line of the process. This command is supported on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
	</p>
	<li>info proc cwd</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current working directory of the process. This command is supported on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
	</p>
	<li>info proc exe</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the name of executable of the process. This command is supported on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
	</p>
	<li>info proc files</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the file descriptors open by the process. For each open file descriptor, GDB shows its number, type (file, directory, character device, socket), file pointer offset, and the name of the resource open on the descriptor. The resource name can be a file name (for files, directories, and devices) or a protocol followed by socket address (for network connections). This command is supported on FreeBSD.
	</p>
	<p>
		This example shows the open file descriptors for a process using a tty for standard input and output as well as two network sockets:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info proc files 22136
process 22136
Open files:

	<li>info proc mappings</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Report the memory address space ranges accessible in a process. On Solaris, FreeBSD and NetBSD systems, each memory range includes information on whether the process has read, write, or execute access rights to each range. On GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD systems, each memory range includes the object file which is mapped to that range.
	</p>
	<li>info proc stat</li>
	<li>info proc status</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show additional process&ndash;related information, including the user ID and group ID; virtual memory usage; the signals that are pending, blocked, and ignored; its TTY; its consumption of system and user time; its stack size; its &lsquo;nice&rsquo; value; etc. These commands are supported on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
	</p>
	<p>
		For GNU/Linux systems, see the &lsquo;proc&rsquo; man page for more information (type man 5 proc from your shell prompt).
	</p>
	<p>
		For FreeBSD and NetBSD systems, info proc stat is an alias for info proc status.
	</p>
	<li>info proc all</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show all the information about the process described under all of the above info proc subcommands.
	</p>
	<li>set procfs&ndash;trace</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command enables and disables tracing of procfs API calls.
	</p>
	<li>show procfs&ndash;trace</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of procfs API call tracing.
	</p>
	<li>set procfs&ndash;file file</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB to write procfs API trace to the named file. GDB appends the trace info to the previous contents of the file. The default is to display the trace on the standard output.
	</p>
	<li>show procfs&ndash;file</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the file to which procfs API trace is written.
	</p>
	<li>proc&ndash;trace&ndash;entry</li>
	<li>proc&ndash;trace&ndash;exit</li>
	<li>proc&ndash;untrace&ndash;entry</li>
	<li>proc&ndash;untrace&ndash;exit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These commands enable and disable tracing of entries into and exits from the syscall interface.
	</p>
	<li>info pidlist</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For QNX Neutrino only, this command displays the list of all the processes and all the threads within each process.
	</p>
	<li>info meminfo</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		For QNX Neutrino only, this command displays the list of all mapinfos.

	<H3><a name="HEAD_ee6bf1a1" href="#TOC_HEAD_ee6bf1a1">21.1.3 Features for Debugging DJGPP Programs</a></H3>
<p>
	DJGPP is a port of the GNU development tools to MS&ndash;DOS and MS&ndash;Windows. DJGPP programs are 32&ndash;bit protected&ndash;mode programs that use the DPMI (DOS Protected&ndash;Mode Interface) API to run on top of real&ndash;mode DOS systems and their emulations.
</p>
<p>
	GDB supports native debugging of DJGPP programs, and defines a few commands specific to the DJGPP port. This subsection describes those commands.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info dos</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is a prefix of DJGPP&ndash;specific commands which print information about the target system and important OS structures.
	</p>
	<li>info dos sysinfo</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command displays assorted information about the underlying platform: the CPU type and features, the OS version and flavor, the DPMI version, and the available conventional and DPMI memory.
	</p>
	<li>info dos gdt</li>
	<li>info dos ldt</li>
	<li>info dos idt</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These 3 commands display entries from, respectively, Global, Local, and Interrupt Descriptor Tables (GDT, LDT, and IDT). The descriptor tables are data structures which store a descriptor for each segment that is currently in use. The segment&rsquo;s selector is an index into a descriptor table; the table entry for that index holds the descriptor&rsquo;s base address and limit, and its attributes and access rights.
	</p>
	<p>
		A typical DJGPP program uses 3 segments: a code segment, a data segment (used for both data and the stack), and a DOS segment (which allows access to DOS/BIOS data structures and absolute addresses in conventional memory). However, the DPMI host will usually define additional segments in order to support the DPMI environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		These commands allow to display entries from the descriptor tables. Without an argument, all entries from the specified table are displayed. An argument, which should be an integer expression, means display a single entry whose index is given by the argument. For example, here&rsquo;s a convenient way to display information about the debugged program&rsquo;s data segment:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) info dos ldt $ds

0x13f: base=0x11970000 limit=0x0009ffff 32-Bit Data (Read/Write, Exp-up)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This comes in handy when you want to see whether a pointer is outside the data segment&rsquo;s limit (i.e. garbled).
	</p>
	<li>info dos pde</li>
	<li>info dos pte</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These two commands display entries from, respectively, the Page Directory and the Page Tables. Page Directories and Page Tables are data structures which control how virtual memory addresses are mapped into physical addresses. A Page Table includes an entry for every page of memory that is mapped into the program&rsquo;s address space; there may be several Page Tables, each one holding up to 4096 entries. A Page Directory has up to 4096 entries, one each for every Page Table that is currently in use.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without an argument, info dos pde displays the entire Page Directory, and info dos pte displays all the entries in all of the Page Tables. An argument, an integer expression, given to the info dos pde command means display only that entry from the Page Directory table. An argument given to the info dos pte command means display entries from a single Page Table, the one pointed to by the specified entry in the Page Directory.
	</p>
	<p>
		These commands are useful when your program uses DMA (Direct Memory Access), which needs physical addresses to program the DMA controller.
	</p>
	<p>
		These commands are supported only with some DPMI servers.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	info dos address&ndash;pte addr
</p>
<pre><code>This command displays the Page Table entry for a specified linear address. The argument addr is a linear address which should already have the appropriate segment’s base address added to it, because this command accepts addresses which may belong to any segment. For example, here’s how to display the Page Table entry for the page where a variable i is stored:

    (gdb) info dos address-pte __djgpp_base_address + (char *)&i

Page Table entry for address 0x11a00d30:

    Base=0x02698000 Dirty Acc. Not-Cached Write-Back Usr Read-Write +0xd30

This says that i is stored at offset 0xd30 from the page whose physical base address is 0x02698000, and shows all the attributes of that page.

Note that you must cast the addresses of variables to a char *, since otherwise the value of __djgpp_base_address, the base address of all variables and functions in a DJGPP program, will be added using the rules of C pointer arithmetics: if i is declared an int, GDB will add 4 times the value of __djgpp_base_address to the address of i.

Here’s another example, it displays the Page Table entry for the transfer buffer:

    (gdb) info dos address-pte *((unsigned *)&_go32_info_block + 3)

    Page Table entry for address 0x29110:

    Base=0x00029000 Dirty Acc. Not-Cached Write-Back Usr Read-Write +0x110

(The + 3 offset is because the transfer buffer’s address is the 3rd member of the _go32_info_block structure.) The output clearly shows that this DPMI server maps the addresses in conventional memory 1:1, i.e. the physical (0x00029000 + 0x110) and linear (0x29110) addresses are identical.

This command is supported only with some DPMI servers.</code></pre>
<p>
	In addition to native debugging, the DJGPP port supports remote debugging via a serial data link. The following commands are specific to remote serial debugging in the DJGPP port of GDB.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set com1base addr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command sets the base I/O port address of the COM1 serial port.
	</p>
	<li>set com1irq irq</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command sets the Interrupt Request (IRQ) line to use for the COM1 serial port.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are similar commands &lsquo;set com2base&rsquo;, &lsquo;set com3irq&rsquo;, etc. for setting the port address and the IRQ lines for the other 3 COM ports.
	</p>
	<p>
		The related commands &lsquo;show com1base&rsquo;, &lsquo;show com1irq&rsquo; etc. display the current settings of the base address and the IRQ lines used by the COM ports.
	</p>
	<li>info serial</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command prints the status of the 4 DOS serial ports. For each port, it prints whether it&rsquo;s active or not, its I/O base address and IRQ number, whether it uses a 16550&ndash;style FIFO, its baudrate, and the counts of various errors encountered so far.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_be60cee1" href="#TOC_HEAD_be60cee1">21.1.4 Features for Debugging MS Windows PE Executables</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB supports native debugging of MS Windows programs, including DLLs with and without symbolic debugging information.
</p>
<p>
	MS&ndash;Windows programs that call SetConsoleMode to switch off the special meaning of the &lsquo;Ctrl&ndash;C&rsquo; keystroke cannot be interrupted by typing C&ndash;c. For this reason, GDB on MS&ndash;Windows supports C&ndash;BREAK as an alternative interrupt key sequence, which can be used to interrupt the debuggee even if it ignores C&ndash;c.
</p>
<p>
	There are various additional Cygwin&ndash;specific commands, described in this section. Working with DLLs that have no debugging symbols is described in Non&ndash;debug DLL Symbols.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>info w32</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This is a prefix of MS Windows&ndash;specific commands which print information about the target system and important OS structures.
	</p>
	<li>info w32 selector</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command displays information returned by the Win32 API GetThreadSelectorEntry function. It takes an optional argument that is evaluated to a long value to give the information about this given selector. Without argument, this command displays information about the six segment registers.
	</p>
	<li>info w32 thread&ndash;information&ndash;block</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command displays thread specific information stored in the Thread Information Block (readable on the X86 CPU family using $fs selector for 32&ndash;bit programs and $gs for 64&ndash;bit programs).
	</p>
	<li>signal&ndash;event id</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command signals an event with user&ndash;provided id. Used to resume crashing process when attached to it using MS&ndash;Windows JIT debugging (AeDebug).
	</p>
	<p>
		To use it, create or edit the following keys in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug and/or HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug (for x86_64 versions):
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&ndash; Debugger (REG_SZ) &mdash; a command to launch the debugger. Suggested command is: fully&ndash;qualified&ndash;path&ndash;to&ndash;gdb.exe &ndash;ex &quot;attach %ld&quot; &ndash;ex &quot;signal&ndash;event %ld&quot; &ndash;ex &quot;continue&quot;.</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The first %ld will be replaced by the process ID of the crashing process, the second %ld will be replaced by the ID of the event that blocks the crashing process, waiting for GDB to attach.
		</p>
		<li>&ndash; Auto (REG_SZ) &mdash; either 1 or 0. 1 will make the system run debugger specified by the Debugger key automatically, 0 will cause a dialog box with &ldquo;OK&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; buttons to appear, which allows the user to either terminate the crashing process (OK) or debug it (Cancel).</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<li>set cygwin&ndash;exceptions mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If mode is on, GDB will break on exceptions that happen inside the Cygwin DLL. If mode is off, GDB will delay recognition of exceptions, and may ignore some exceptions which seem to be caused by internal Cygwin DLL &ldquo;bookkeeping&rdquo;. This option is meant primarily for debugging the Cygwin DLL itself; the default value is off to avoid annoying GDB users with false SIGSEGV signals.
	</p>
	<li>show cygwin&ndash;exceptions</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays whether GDB will break on exceptions that happen inside the Cygwin DLL itself.
	</p>
	<li>set new&ndash;console mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If mode is on the debuggee will be started in a new console on next start. If mode is off, the debuggee will be started in the same console as the debugger.
	</p>
	<li>show new&ndash;console</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays whether a new console is used when the debuggee is started.
	</p>
	<li>set new&ndash;group mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This boolean value controls whether the debuggee should start a new group or stay in the same group as the debugger. This affects the way the Windows OS handles &lsquo;Ctrl&ndash;C&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>show new&ndash;group</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays current value of new&ndash;group boolean.
	</p>
	<li>set debugevents</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This boolean value adds debug output concerning kernel events related to the debuggee seen by the debugger. This includes events that signal thread and process creation and exit, DLL loading and unloading, console interrupts, and debugging messages produced by the Windows OutputDebugString API call.
	</p>
	<li>set debugexec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This boolean value adds debug output concerning execute events (such as resume thread) seen by the debugger.
	</p>
	<li>set debugexceptions</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This boolean value adds debug output concerning exceptions in the debuggee seen by the debugger.
	</p>
	<li>set debugmemory</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This boolean value adds debug output concerning debuggee memory reads and writes by the debugger.
	</p>
	<li>set shell</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This boolean values specifies whether the debuggee is called via a shell or directly (default value is on).
	</p>
	<li>show shell</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays if the debuggee will be started with a shell.
	</p>
</ul>

	• Non&ndash;debug DLL Symbols: Support for DLLs without debugging symbols
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_2fb8b69d" href="#TOC_HEAD_2fb8b69d">21.1.4.1 Support for DLLs without Debugging Symbols</a></H4>
<p>
	Very often on windows, some of the DLLs that your program relies on do not include symbolic debugging information (for example, kernel32.dll). When GDB doesn&rsquo;t recognize any debugging symbols in a DLL, it relies on the minimal amount of symbolic information contained in the DLL&rsquo;s export table. This section describes working with such symbols, known internally to GDB as &ldquo;minimal symbols&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
	Note that before the debugged program has started execution, no DLLs will have been loaded. The easiest way around this problem is simply to start the program &mdash; either by setting a breakpoint or letting the program run once to completion.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_26a1e085" href="#TOC_HEAD_26a1e085">21.1.4.2 DLL Name Prefixes</a></H4>
<p>
	In keeping with the naming conventions used by the Microsoft debugging tools, DLL export symbols are made available with a prefix based on the DLL name, for instance KERNEL32!CreateFileA. The plain name is also entered into the symbol table, so CreateFileA is often sufficient. In some cases there will be name clashes within a program (particularly if the executable itself includes full debugging symbols) necessitating the use of the fully qualified name when referring to the contents of the DLL. Use single&ndash;quotes around the name to avoid the exclamation mark (&ldquo;!&rdquo;) being interpreted as a language operator.
</p>
<p>
	Note that the internal name of the DLL may be all upper&ndash;case, even though the file name of the DLL is lower&ndash;case, or vice&ndash;versa. Since symbols within GDB are case&ndash;sensitive this may cause some confusion. If in doubt, try the info functions and info variables commands or even maint print msymbols (see Symbols). Here&rsquo;s an example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info function CreateFileA
All functions matching regular expression "CreateFileA":

Non-debugging symbols:
0x77e885f4  CreateFileA
0x77e885f4  KERNEL32!CreateFileA

(gdb) info function !
All functions matching regular expression "!":

Non-debugging symbols:
0x6100114c  cygwin1!__assert
0x61004034  cygwin1!_dll_crt0@0
0x61004240  cygwin1!dll_crt0(per_process *)
[etc...]</code></pre>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_27d26e64" href="#TOC_HEAD_27d26e64">21.1.4.3 Working with Minimal Symbols</a></H4>
<p>
	Symbols extracted from a DLL&rsquo;s export table do not contain very much type information. All that GDB can do is guess whether a symbol refers to a function or variable depending on the linker section that contains the symbol. Also note that the actual contents of the memory contained in a DLL are not available unless the program is running. This means that you cannot examine the contents of a variable or disassemble a function within a DLL without a running program.
</p>
<p>
	Variables are generally treated as pointers and dereferenced automatically. For this reason, it is often necessary to prefix a variable name with the address&ndash;of operator (&ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;) and provide explicit type information in the command. Here&rsquo;s an example of the type of problem:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print 'cygwin1!__argv'

<p>
	And two possible solutions:
</p>

$2 = 0x22fd98 "/cygdrive/c/mydirectory/myprogram"

(gdb) x/2x &'cygwin1!__argv'

<p>
	Setting a break point within a DLL is possible even before the program starts execution. However, under these circumstances, GDB can&rsquo;t examine the initial instructions of the function in order to skip the function&rsquo;s frame set&ndash;up code. You can work around this by using &ldquo;*&amp;&rdquo; to set the breakpoint at a raw memory address:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) break *&'python22!PyOS_Readline'
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1e04eff0</code></pre>
<p>
	The author of these extensions is not entirely convinced that setting a break point within a shared DLL like kernel32.dll is completely safe.

<p>
	This subsection describes GDB commands specific to the GNU Hurd native debugging.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set signals</li>
	<li>set sigs</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command toggles the state of inferior signal interception by GDB. Mach exceptions, such as breakpoint traps, are not affected by this command. sigs is a shorthand alias for signals.
	</p>
	<li>show signals</li>
	<li>show sigs</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of intercepting inferior&rsquo;s signals.
	</p>
	<li>set signal&ndash;thread</li>
	<li>set sigthread</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command tells GDB which thread is the libc signal thread. That thread is run when a signal is delivered to a running process. set sigthread is the shorthand alias of set signal&ndash;thread.
	</p>
	<li>show signal&ndash;thread</li>
	<li>show sigthread</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These two commands show which thread will run when the inferior is delivered a signal.
	</p>
	<li>set stopped</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This commands tells GDB that the inferior process is stopped, as with the SIGSTOP signal. The stopped process can be continued by delivering a signal to it.
	</p>
	<li>show stopped</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command shows whether GDB thinks the debuggee is stopped.
	</p>
	<li>set exceptions</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use this command to turn off trapping of exceptions in the inferior. When exception trapping is off, neither breakpoints nor single&ndash;stepping will work. To restore the default, set exception trapping on.
	</p>
	<li>show exceptions</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of trapping exceptions in the inferior.
	</p>
	<li>set task pause</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command toggles task suspension when GDB has control. Setting it to on takes effect immediately, and the task is suspended whenever GDB gets control. Setting it to off will take effect the next time the inferior is continued. If this option is set to off, you can use set thread default pause on or set thread pause on (see below) to pause individual threads.
	</p>
	<li>show task pause</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of task suspension.
	</p>
	<li>set task detach&ndash;suspend&ndash;count</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command sets the suspend count the task will be left with when GDB detaches from it.
	</p>
	<li>show task detach&ndash;suspend&ndash;count</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the suspend count the task will be left with when detaching.
	</p>
	<li>set task exception&ndash;port</li>
	<li>set task excp</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command sets the task exception port to which GDB will forward exceptions. The argument should be the value of the send rights of the task. set task excp is a shorthand alias.
	</p>
	<li>set noninvasive</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command switches GDB to a mode that is the least invasive as far as interfering with the inferior is concerned. This is the same as using set task pause, set exceptions, and set signals to values opposite to the defaults.
	</p>
	<li>info send&ndash;rights</li>
	<li>info receive&ndash;rights</li>
	<li>info port&ndash;rights</li>
	<li>info port&ndash;sets</li>
	<li>info dead&ndash;names</li>
	<li>info ports</li>
	<li>info psets</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These commands display information about, respectively, send rights, receive rights, port rights, port sets, and dead names of a task. There are also shorthand aliases: info ports for info port&ndash;rights and info psets for info port&ndash;sets.
	</p>
	<li>set thread pause</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command toggles current thread suspension when GDB has control. Setting it to on takes effect immediately, and the current thread is suspended whenever GDB gets control. Setting it to off will take effect the next time the inferior is continued. Normally, this command has no effect, since when GDB has control, the whole task is suspended. However, if you used set task pause off (see above), this command comes in handy to suspend only the current thread.
	</p>
	<li>show thread pause</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command shows the state of current thread suspension.
	</p>
	<li>set thread run</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command sets whether the current thread is allowed to run.
	</p>
	<li>show thread run</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether the current thread is allowed to run.
	</p>
	<li>set thread detach&ndash;suspend&ndash;count</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command sets the suspend count GDB will leave on a thread when detaching. This number is relative to the suspend count found by GDB when it notices the thread; use set thread takeover&ndash;suspend&ndash;count to force it to an absolute value.
	</p>
	<li>show thread detach&ndash;suspend&ndash;count</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the suspend count GDB will leave on the thread when detaching.
	</p>
	<li>set thread exception&ndash;port</li>
	<li>set thread excp</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the thread exception port to which to forward exceptions. This overrides the port set by set task exception&ndash;port (see above). set thread excp is the shorthand alias.
	</p>
	<li>set thread takeover&ndash;suspend&ndash;count</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Normally, GDB&rsquo;s thread suspend counts are relative to the value GDB finds when it notices each thread. This command changes the suspend counts to be absolute instead.
	</p>
	<li>set thread default</li>
	<li>show thread default</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Each of the above set thread commands has a set thread default counterpart (e.g., set thread default pause, set thread default exception&ndash;port, etc.). The thread default variety of commands sets the default thread properties for all threads; you can then change the properties of individual threads with the non&ndash;default commands.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_35e7939d" href="#TOC_HEAD_35e7939d">21.1.6 Darwin</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB provides the following commands specific to the Darwin target:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set debug darwin num</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When set to a non zero value, enables debugging messages specific to the Darwin support. Higher values produce more verbose output.
	</p>
	<li>show debug darwin</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of Darwin messages.
	</p>
	<li>set debug mach&ndash;o num</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When set to a non zero value, enables debugging messages while GDB is reading Darwin object files. (Mach&ndash;O is the file format used on Darwin for object and executable files.) Higher values produce more verbose output. This is a command to diagnose problems internal to GDB and should not be needed in normal usage.
	</p>
	<li>show debug mach&ndash;o</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of Mach&ndash;O file messages.
	</p>
	<li>set mach&ndash;exceptions on</li>
	<li>set mach&ndash;exceptions off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		On Darwin, faults are first reported as a Mach exception and are then mapped to a Posix signal. Use this command to turn on trapping of Mach exceptions in the inferior. This might be sometimes useful to better understand the cause of a fault. The default is off.
	</p>
	<li>show mach&ndash;exceptions</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of exceptions trapping.
	</p>
</ul>

<p>
	When the ABI of a system call is changed in the FreeBSD kernel, this is implemented by leaving a compatibility system call using the old ABI at the existing number and allocating a new system call number for the version using the new ABI. As a convenience, when a system call is caught by name (see catch syscall), compatibility system calls are also caught.
</p>
<p>
	For example, FreeBSD 12 introduced a new variant of the kevent system call and catching the kevent system call by name catches both variants:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) catch syscall kevent
Catchpoint 1 (syscalls 'freebsd11_kevent' [363] 'kevent' [560])

<p>
	This section goes into details specific to particular embedded configurations.
</p>
<p>
	Whenever a specific embedded processor has a simulator, GDB allows to send an arbitrary command to the simulator.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>sim command</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Send an arbitrary command string to the simulator. Consult the documentation for the specific simulator in use for information about acceptable commands.

</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_95c48a2f" href="#TOC_HEAD_95c48a2f">21.3.1 Synopsys ARC</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB provides the following ARC&ndash;specific commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set debug arc</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the level of ARC specific debug messages. Use 0 for no messages (the default), 1 for debug messages, and 2 for even more debug messages.
	</p>
	<li>show debug arc</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the level of ARC specific debugging in operation.
	</p>
	<li>maint print arc arc&ndash;instruction address</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print internal disassembler information about instruction at a given address.

</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_9d144324" href="#TOC_HEAD_9d144324">21.3.2 ARM</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB provides the following ARM&ndash;specific commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set arm disassembler</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This commands selects from a list of disassembly styles. The &quot;std&quot; style is the standard style.
	</p>
	<li>show arm disassembler</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current disassembly style.
	</p>
	<li>set arm apcs32</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command toggles ARM operation mode between 32&ndash;bit and 26&ndash;bit.
	</p>
	<li>show arm apcs32</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current usage of the ARM 32&ndash;bit mode.
	</p>
	<li>set arm fpu fputype</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command sets the ARM floating&ndash;point unit (FPU) type. The argument fputype can be one of these:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>auto</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Determine the FPU type by querying the OS ABI.
		</p>
		<li>softfpa</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			Software FPU, with mixed&ndash;endian doubles on little&ndash;endian ARM processors.

	</ul>
	<li>show arm fpu</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current type of the FPU.
	</p>
	<li>set arm abi</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command forces GDB to use the specified ABI.
	</p>
	<li>show arm abi</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the currently used ABI.
	</p>
	<li>set arm fallback&ndash;mode (arm|thumb|auto)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB uses the symbol table, when available, to determine whether instructions are ARM or Thumb. This command controls GDB&rsquo;s default behavior when the symbol table is not available. The default is &lsquo;auto&rsquo;, which causes GDB to use the current execution mode (from the T bit in the CPSR register).
	</p>
	<li>show arm fallback&ndash;mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current fallback instruction mode.
	</p>
	<li>set arm force&ndash;mode (arm|thumb|auto)</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command overrides use of the symbol table to determine whether instructions are ARM or Thumb. The default is &lsquo;auto&rsquo;, which causes GDB to use the symbol table and then the setting of &lsquo;set arm fallback&ndash;mode&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>show arm force&ndash;mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current forced instruction mode.
	</p>
	<li>set arm unwind&ndash;secure&ndash;frames</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command enables unwinding from Non&ndash;secure to Secure mode on Cortex&ndash;M with Security extension. This can trigger security exceptions when unwinding the exception stack. It is enabled by default.
	</p>
	<li>show arm unwind&ndash;secure&ndash;frames</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether unwinding from Non&ndash;secure to Secure mode is enabled.
	</p>
	<li>set debug arm</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Toggle whether to display ARM&ndash;specific debugging messages from the ARM target support subsystem.

		The GDB ARM simulator accepts the following optional arguments.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&ndash;&ndash;swi&ndash;support=type</li>

</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_e89fb0b3" href="#TOC_HEAD_e89fb0b3">21.3.5 MicroBlaze</a></H3>
<p>
	The MicroBlaze is a soft&ndash;core processor supported on various Xilinx FPGAs, such as Spartan or Virtex series. Boards with these processors usually have JTAG ports which connect to a host system running the Xilinx Embedded Development Kit (EDK) or Software Development Kit (SDK). This host system is used to download the configuration bitstream to the target FPGA. The Xilinx Microprocessor Debugger (XMD) program communicates with the target board using the JTAG interface and presents a gdbserver interface to the board. By default xmd uses port 1234. (While it is possible to change this default port, it requires the use of undocumented xmd commands. Contact Xilinx support if you need to do this.)
</p>
<p>
	Use these GDB commands to connect to the MicroBlaze target processor.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>target remote :1234</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use this command to connect to the target if you are running GDB on the same system as xmd.
	</p>
	<li>target remote xmd&ndash;host:1234</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use this command to connect to the target if it is connected to xmd running on a different system named xmd&ndash;host.
	</p>
	<li>load</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use this command to download a program to the MicroBlaze target.
	</p>
	<li>set debug microblaze n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable MicroBlaze&ndash;specific debugging messages if non&ndash;zero.
	</p>
	<li>show debug microblaze n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show MicroBlaze&ndash;specific debugging level.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_1d15f0f7" href="#TOC_HEAD_1d15f0f7">21.3.6 MIPS Embedded</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB supports these special commands for MIPS targets:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set mipsfpu double</li>
	<li>set mipsfpu single</li>
	<li>set mipsfpu none</li>
	<li>set mipsfpu auto</li>
	<li>show mipsfpu</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If your target board does not support the MIPS floating point coprocessor, you should use the command &lsquo;set mipsfpu none&rsquo; (if you need this, you may wish to put the command in your GDB init file). This tells GDB how to find the return value of functions which return floating point values. It also allows GDB to avoid saving the floating point registers when calling functions on the board. If you are using a floating point coprocessor with only single precision floating point support, as on the R4650 processor, use the command &lsquo;set mipsfpu single&rsquo;. The default double precision floating point coprocessor may be selected using &lsquo;set mipsfpu double&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		In previous versions the only choices were double precision or no floating point, so &lsquo;set mipsfpu on&rsquo; will select double precision and &lsquo;set mipsfpu off&rsquo; will select no floating point.
	</p>
	<p>
		As usual, you can inquire about the mipsfpu variable with &lsquo;show mipsfpu&rsquo;.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_773f051b" href="#TOC_HEAD_773f051b">21.3.7 OpenRISC 1000</a></H3>
<p>
	The OpenRISC 1000 provides a free RISC instruction set architecture. It is mainly provided as a soft&ndash;core which can run on Xilinx, Altera and other FPGA&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
	GDB for OpenRISC supports the below commands when connecting to a target:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>target sim</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Runs the builtin CPU simulator which can run very basic programs but does not support most hardware functions like MMU. For more complex use cases the user is advised to run an external target, and connect using &lsquo;target remote&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example: target sim
	</p>
	<li>set debug or1k</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Toggle whether to display OpenRISC&ndash;specific debugging messages from the OpenRISC target support subsystem.
	</p>
	<li>show debug or1k</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether OpenRISC&ndash;specific debugging messages are enabled.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_da536d04" href="#TOC_HEAD_da536d04">21.3.8 PowerPC Embedded</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB supports using the DVC (Data Value Compare) register to implement in hardware simple hardware watchpoint conditions of the form:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) watch address|variable \
if  address|variable == constant expression</code></pre>
<p>
	The DVC register will be automatically used when GDB detects such pattern in a condition expression, and the created watchpoint uses one debug register (either the exact&ndash;watchpoints option is on and the variable is scalar, or the variable has a length of one byte). This feature is available in native GDB running on a Linux kernel version 2.6.34 or newer.
</p>
<p>
	When running on PowerPC embedded processors, GDB automatically uses ranged hardware watchpoints, unless the exact&ndash;watchpoints option is on, in which case watchpoints using only one debug register are created when watching variables of scalar types.
</p>
<p>
	You can create an artificial array to watch an arbitrary memory region using one of the following commands (see Expressions):
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) watch *((char *) address)@length
(gdb) watch {char[length]} address</code></pre>
<p>
	PowerPC embedded processors support masked watchpoints. See the discussion about the mask argument in Set Watchpoints.
</p>
<p>
	PowerPC embedded processors support hardware accelerated ranged breakpoints. A ranged breakpoint stops execution of the inferior whenever it executes an instruction at any address within the range it was set at. To set a ranged breakpoint in GDB, use the break&ndash;range command.
</p>
<p>
	GDB provides the following PowerPC&ndash;specific commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>break&ndash;range start&ndash;locspec, end&ndash;locspec</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set a breakpoint for an address range given by start&ndash;locspec and end&ndash;locspec, which are location specs. See Location Specifications, for a list of all the possible forms of location specs. GDB resolves both start&ndash;locspec and end&ndash;locspec, and uses the addresses of the resolved code locations as start and end addresses of the range to break at. The breakpoint will stop execution of the inferior whenever it executes an instruction at any address between the start and end addresses, inclusive. If either start&ndash;locspec or end&ndash;locspec resolve to multiple code locations in the program, then the command aborts with an error without creating a breakpoint.

	This section describes characteristics of architectures that affect all uses of GDB with the architecture, both native and cross.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_8b0be5dd" href="#TOC_HEAD_8b0be5dd">21.4.1 AArch64</a></H3>
<p>
	When GDB is debugging the AArch64 architecture, it provides the following special commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set debug aarch64</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command determines whether AArch64 architecture&ndash;specific debugging messages are to be displayed.
	</p>
	<li>show debug aarch64</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether AArch64 debugging messages are displayed.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_22d4b3ac" href="#TOC_HEAD_22d4b3ac">21.4.1.1 AArch64 SVE.</a></H4>
<p>
	When GDB is debugging the AArch64 architecture, if the Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) is present, then GDB will provide the vector registers $z0 through $z31, vector predicate registers $p0 through $p15, and the $ffr register. In addition, the pseudo register $vg will be provided. This is the vector granule for the current thread and represents the number of 64&ndash;bit chunks in an SVE z register.
</p>
<p>
	If the vector length changes, then the $vg register will be updated, but the lengths of the z and p registers will not change. This is a known limitation of GDB and does not affect the execution of the target process.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_1b20fb14" href="#TOC_HEAD_1b20fb14">21.4.1.2 AArch64 Pointer Authentication.</a></H4>
<p>
	When GDB is debugging the AArch64 architecture, and the program is using the v8.3&ndash;A feature Pointer Authentication (PAC), then whenever the link register $lr is pointing to an PAC function its value will be masked. When GDB prints a backtrace, any addresses that required unmasking will be postfixed with the marker [PAC]. When using the MI, this is printed as part of the addr_flags field.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_6bc5cfbb" href="#TOC_HEAD_6bc5cfbb">21.4.1.3 AArch64 Memory Tagging Extension.</a></H4>
<p>
	When GDB is debugging the AArch64 architecture, the program is using the v8.5&ndash;A feature Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) and there is support in the kernel for MTE, GDB will make memory tagging functionality available for inspection and editing of logical and allocation tags. See Memory Tagging.
</p>
<p>
	To aid debugging, GDB will output additional information when SIGSEGV signals are generated as a result of memory tag failures.
</p>
<p>
	If the tag violation is synchronous, the following will be shown:
</p>
<pre><code>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
Memory tag violation while accessing address 0x0500fffff7ff8000
Allocation tag 0x1
Logical tag 0x5.</code></pre>
<p>
	If the tag violation is asynchronous, the fault address is not available. In this case GDB will show the following:
</p>
<pre><code>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
Memory tag violation
Fault address unavailable.</code></pre>
<p>
	A special register, tag_ctl, is made available through the org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.mte feature. This register exposes some options that can be controlled at runtime and emulates the prctl option PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL. For further information, see the documentation in the Linux kernel.
</p>
<p>
	GDB supports dumping memory tag data to core files through the gcore command and reading memory tag data from core files generated by the gcore command or the Linux kernel.
</p>
<p>
	When a process uses memory&ndash;mapped pages protected by memory tags (for example, AArch64 MTE), this additional information will be recorded in the core file in the event of a crash or if GDB generates a core file from the current process state.
</p>
<p>
	The memory tag data will be used so developers can display the memory tags from a particular memory region (using the &lsquo;m&rsquo; modifier to the x command, using the print command or using the various memory&ndash;tag subcommands.
</p>
<p>
	In the case of a crash, GDB will attempt to retrieve the memory tag information automatically from the core file, and will show one of the above messages depending on whether the synchronous or asynchronous mode is selected. See Memory Tagging. See Memory.

	<H4><a name="HEAD_a05d2538" href="#TOC_HEAD_a05d2538">21.4.2.1 Intel Memory Protection Extensions (MPX).</a></H4>
<p>
	Memory Protection Extension (MPX) adds the bound registers &lsquo;BND0&rsquo; 17 through &lsquo;BND3&rsquo;. Bound registers store a pair of 64&ndash;bit values which are the lower bound and upper bound. Bounds are effective addresses or memory locations. The upper bounds are architecturally represented in 1&rsquo;s complement form. A bound having lower bound = 0, and upper bound = 0 (1&rsquo;s complement of all bits set) will allow access to the entire address space.
</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;BND0&rsquo; through &lsquo;BND3&rsquo; are represented in GDB as &lsquo;bnd0raw&rsquo; through &lsquo;bnd3raw&rsquo;. Pseudo registers &lsquo;bnd0&rsquo; through &lsquo;bnd3&rsquo; display the upper bound performing the complement of one operation on the upper bound value, i.e. when upper bound in &lsquo;bnd0raw&rsquo; is 0 in the GDB &lsquo;bnd0&rsquo; it will be 0xfff&hellip;. In this sense it can also be noted that the upper bounds are inclusive.
</p>
<p>
	As an example, assume that the register BND0 holds bounds for a pointer having access allowed for the range between 0x32 and 0x71. The values present on bnd0raw and bnd registers are presented as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>bnd0raw = {0x32, 0xffffffff8e}
bnd0 = {lbound = 0x32, ubound = 0x71} : size 64</code></pre>
<p>
	This way the raw value can be accessed via bnd0raw&hellip;bnd3raw. Any change on bnd0&hellip;bnd3 or bnd0raw&hellip;bnd3raw is reflect on its counterpart. When the bnd0&hellip;bnd3 registers are displayed via Python, the display includes the memory size, in bits, accessible to the pointer.
</p>
<p>
	Bounds can also be stored in bounds tables, which are stored in application memory. These tables store bounds for pointers by specifying the bounds pointer&rsquo;s value along with its bounds. Evaluating and changing bounds located in bound tables is therefore interesting while investigating bugs on MPX context. GDB provides commands for this purpose:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>show mpx bound pointer</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display bounds of the given pointer.
	</p>
	<li>set mpx bound pointer, lbound, ubound</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the bounds of a pointer in the bound table. This command takes three parameters: pointer is the pointers whose bounds are to be changed, lbound and ubound are new values for lower and upper bounds respectively.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	When you call an inferior function on an Intel MPX enabled program, GDB sets the inferior&rsquo;s bound registers to the init (disabled) state before calling the function. As a consequence, bounds checks for the pointer arguments passed to the function will always pass.
</p>
<p>
	This is necessary because when you call an inferior function, the program is usually in the middle of the execution of other function. Since at that point bound registers are in an arbitrary state, not clearing them would lead to random bound violations in the called function.
</p>
<p>
	You can still examine the influence of the bound registers on the execution of the called function by stopping the execution of the called function at its prologue, setting bound registers, and continuing the execution. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>$ break *upper
Breakpoint 2 at 0x4009de: file i386-mpx-call.c, line 47.
$ print upper (a, b, c, d, 1)
Breakpoint 2, upper (a=0x0, b=0x6e0000005b, c=0x0, d=0x0, len=48)....
$ print $bnd0
{lbound = 0x0, ubound = ffffffff} : size -1</code></pre>
<p>
	At this last step the value of bnd0 can be changed for investigation of bound violations caused along the execution of the call. In order to know how to set the bound registers or bound table for the call consult the ABI.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_72471668" href="#TOC_HEAD_72471668">21.4.3 Alpha</a></H3>

	See the following section.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_70c452d4" href="#TOC_HEAD_70c452d4">21.4.4 MIPS</a></H3>
<p>
	Alpha&ndash; and MIPS&ndash;based computers use an unusual stack frame, which sometimes requires GDB to search backward in the object code to find the beginning of a function.
</p>
<p>
	To improve response time (especially for embedded applications, where GDB may be restricted to a slow serial line for this search) you may want to limit the size of this search, using one of these commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set heuristic&ndash;fence&ndash;post limit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Restrict GDB to examining at most limit bytes in its search for the beginning of a function. A value of 0 (the default) means there is no limit. However, except for 0, the larger the limit the more bytes heuristic&ndash;fence&ndash;post must search and therefore the longer it takes to run. You should only need to use this command when debugging a stripped executable.
	</p>
	<li>show heuristic&ndash;fence&ndash;post</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current limit.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	These commands are available only when GDB is configured for debugging programs on Alpha or MIPS processors.
</p>
<p>
	Several MIPS&ndash;specific commands are available when debugging MIPS programs:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set mips abi arg</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB which MIPS ABI is used by the inferior. Possible values of arg are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&lsquo;auto&rsquo;</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			The default ABI associated with the current binary (this is the default).
		</p>
		<li>&lsquo;o32&rsquo;</li>
		<li>&lsquo;o64&rsquo;</li>
		<li>&lsquo;n32&rsquo;</li>
		<li>&lsquo;n64&rsquo;</li>
		<li>&lsquo;eabi32&rsquo;</li>
		<li>&lsquo;eabi64&rsquo;</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<li>show mips abi</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the MIPS ABI used by GDB to debug the inferior.
	</p>
	<li>set mips compression arg</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Tell GDB which MIPS compressed ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) encoding is used by the inferior. GDB uses this for code disassembly and other internal interpretation purposes. This setting is only referred to when no executable has been associated with the debugging session or the executable does not provide information about the encoding it uses. Otherwise this setting is automatically updated from information provided by the executable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Possible values of arg are &lsquo;mips16&rsquo; and &lsquo;micromips&rsquo;. The default compressed ISA encoding is &lsquo;mips16&rsquo;, as executables containing MIPS16 code frequently are not identified as such.
	</p>
	<p>
		This setting is &ldquo;sticky&rdquo;; that is, it retains its value across debugging sessions until reset either explicitly with this command or implicitly from an executable.
	</p>
	<p>
		The compiler and/or assembler typically add symbol table annotations to identify functions compiled for the MIPS16 or microMIPS ISAs. If these function&ndash;scope annotations are present, GDB uses them in preference to the global compressed ISA encoding setting.
	</p>
	<li>show mips compression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the MIPS compressed ISA encoding used by GDB to debug the inferior.
	</p>
	<li>set mipsfpu</li>
	<li>show mipsfpu</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		See set mipsfpu.
	</p>
	<li>set mips mask&ndash;address arg</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command determines whether the most&ndash;significant 32 bits of 64&ndash;bit MIPS addresses are masked off. The argument arg can be &lsquo;on&rsquo;, &lsquo;off&rsquo;, or &lsquo;auto&rsquo;. The latter is the default setting, which lets GDB determine the correct value.
	</p>
	<li>show mips mask&ndash;address</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether the upper 32 bits of MIPS addresses are masked off or not.
	</p>
	<li>set remote&ndash;mips64&ndash;transfers&ndash;32bit&ndash;regs</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command controls compatibility with 64&ndash;bit MIPS targets that transfer data in 32&ndash;bit quantities. If you have an old MIPS 64 target that transfers 32 bits for some registers, like SR and FSR, and 64 bits for other registers, set this option to &lsquo;on&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>show remote&ndash;mips64&ndash;transfers&ndash;32bit&ndash;regs</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of compatibility with older MIPS 64 targets.

<p>
	When GDB is debugging the PowerPC architecture, it provides a set of pseudo&ndash;registers to enable inspection of 128&ndash;bit wide Decimal Floating Point numbers stored in the floating point registers. These values must be stored in two consecutive registers, always starting at an even register like f0 or f2.
</p>
<p>
	The pseudo&ndash;registers go from $dl0 through $dl15, and are formed by joining the even/odd register pairs f0 and f1 for $dl0, f2 and f3 for $dl1 and so on.

	<H4><a name="HEAD_9d3059c7" href="#TOC_HEAD_9d3059c7">21.4.8.1 ADI Support</a></H4>
<p>
	The M7 processor supports an Application Data Integrity (ADI) feature that detects invalid data accesses. When software allocates memory and enables ADI on the allocated memory, it chooses a 4&ndash;bit version number, sets the version in the upper 4 bits of the 64&ndash;bit pointer to that data, and stores the 4&ndash;bit version in every cacheline of that data. Hardware saves the latter in spare bits in the cache and memory hierarchy. On each load and store, the processor compares the upper 4 VA (virtual address) bits to the cacheline&rsquo;s version. If there is a mismatch, the processor generates a version mismatch trap which can be either precise or disrupting. The trap is an error condition which the kernel delivers to the process as a SIGSEGV signal.
</p>
<p>
	Note that only 64&ndash;bit applications can use ADI and need to be built with ADI&ndash;enabled.
</p>
<p>
	Values of the ADI version tags, which are in granularity of a cacheline (64 bytes), can be viewed or modified.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>adi (examine | x) [ / n ] addr</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The adi examine command displays the value of one ADI version tag per cacheline.
	</p>
	<p>
		n is a decimal integer specifying the number in bytes; the default is 1. It specifies how much ADI version information, at the ratio of 1:ADI block size, to display.
	</p>
	<p>
		addr is the address in user address space where you want GDB to begin displaying the ADI version tags.
	</p>
	<p>
		Below is an example of displaying ADI versions of variable &quot;shmaddr&quot;.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) adi x/100 shmaddr
0xfff800010002c000:     0 0	</code></pre>
	<li>adi (assign | a) [ / n ] addr = tag</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The adi assign command is used to assign new ADI version tag to an address.
	</p>
	<p>
		n is a decimal integer specifying the number in bytes; the default is 1. It specifies how much ADI version information, at the ratio of 1:ADI block size, to modify.
	</p>
	<p>
		addr is the address in user address space where you want GDB to begin modifying the ADI version tags.
	</p>
	<p>
		tag is the new ADI version tag.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, do the following to modify then verify ADI versions of variable &quot;shmaddr&quot;:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) adi a/100 shmaddr = 7
(gdb) adi x/100 shmaddr
0xfff800010002c000:     7 7	</code></pre>

</p>
<p>
	GDB requires each agent to have compatible firmware installed by the device driver. A warning message is displayed if unsupported firmware is detected. GDB will continue to function except no AMD GPU debugging will be possible on the agent.
</p>
<p>
	GDB requires a compatible AMD ROCm runtime to be loaded in order to detect AMD GPU code objects and wavefronts.

</p>
<p>
	Note that some AMD GPU architectures may have restrictions on providing information about AMD GPU wavefronts created when GDB is not attached (see AMD GPU Attaching Restrictions).
</p>

	<H4><a name="HEAD_f7fa772f" href="#TOC_HEAD_f7fa772f">21.4.10.4 AMD GPU Code Objects</a></H4>
<p>
	The &lsquo;info sharedlibrary&rsquo; command will show the AMD GPU code objects as file or memory URIs, together with the host&rsquo;s shared libraries. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info sharedlibrary
From    To      Syms Read   Shared Object Library
0x1111  0x2222  Yes (*)     /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
...
0x3333  0x4444  Yes (*)     /opt/rocm-4.5.0/.../libamd_comgr.so
0x5555  0x6666  Yes (*)     /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5
0x7777  0x8888  Yes         file:///tmp/a.out#offset=6477&size=10832
0x9999  0xaaaa  Yes (*)     memory://95557/mem#offset=0x1234&size=100
(*): Shared library is missing debugging information.
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	For a &lsquo;file&rsquo; URI, the path portion is the file on disk containing the code object. The offset parameter is a 0&ndash;based offset in this file, to the start of the code object. If omitted, it defaults to 0. The size parameter is the size of the code object in bytes. If omitted, it defaults to the size of the file.
</p>
<p>
	For a &lsquo;memory&rsquo; URI, the path portion is the process id of the process owning the memory containing the code object. The offset parameter is the memory address where the code object is found, and the size parameter is its size in bytes.
</p>
<p>
	AMD GPU code objects are loaded into each AMD GPU device separately. The &lsquo;info sharedlibrary&rsquo; command may therefore show the same code object loaded multiple times. As a consequence, setting a breakpoint in AMD GPU code will result in multiple breakpoint locations if there are multiple AMD GPU devices.

<p>
	For AMD GPU wavefronts, GDB maps target conditions to stop signals in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>SIGILL</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execution of an illegal instruction.
	</p>
	<li>SIGTRAP</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execution of a S_TRAP instruction other than:
	</p>
	<pre><code>S_TRAP 1 which is used by GDB to insert breakpoints.
S_TRAP 2 which raises SIGABRT.	</code></pre>
	<li>SIGABRT</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execution of a S_TRAP 2 instruction.
	</p>
	<li>SIGFPE</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execution of a floating point or integer instruction detects a condition that is enabled to raise a signal. The conditions include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Floating point operation is invalid.</li>
		<li>Floating point operation had subnormal input that was rounded to zero.</li>
		<li>Floating point operation performed a division by zero.</li>
		<li>Floating point operation produced an overflow result. The result was rounded to infinity.</li>
		<li>Floating point operation produced an underflow result. A subnormal result was rounded to zero.</li>
		<li>Floating point operation produced an inexact result.</li>
		<li>Integer operation performed a division by zero.</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<p>
		By default, these conditions are not enabled to raise signals. The &lsquo;set $mode&rsquo; command can be used to change the AMD GPU wavefront&rsquo;s register that has bits controlling which conditions are enabled to raise signals. The &lsquo;print $trapsts&rsquo; command can be used to inspect which conditions have been detected even if they are not enabled to raise a signal.
	</p>
	<li>SIGBUS</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execution of an instruction that accessed global memory using an address that is outside the virtual address range.
	</p>
	<li>SIGSEGV</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execution of an instruction that accessed a global memory page that is either not mapped or accessed with incompatible permissions.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If a single instruction raises more than one signal, they will be reported one at a time each time the wavefront is continued.

<ol>
	<li>When in non&ndash;stop mode, wavefronts may not hit breakpoints inserted while not stopped, nor see memory updates made while not stopped, until the wavefront is next stopped. Memory updated by non&ndash;stopped wavefronts may not be visible until the wavefront is next stopped.</li>
	<li>The HIP runtime performs deferred code object loading by default. AMD GPU code objects are not loaded until the first kernel is launched. Before then, all breakpoints have to be set as pending breakpoints.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If source line positions are used that only correspond to source lines in unloaded code objects, then GDB may not set pending breakpoints, and instead set breakpoints on the next following source line that maps to host code. This can result in unexpected breakpoint hits being reported. When the code object containing the source lines is loaded, the incorrect breakpoints will be removed and replaced by the correct ones. This problem can be avoided by only setting breakpoints in unloaded code objects using symbol or function names.
	</p>
	<p>
		Setting the HIP_ENABLE_DEFERRED_LOADING environment variable to 0 can be used to disable deferred code object loading by the HIP runtime. This ensures all code objects will be loaded when the inferior reaches the beginning of the main function.
	</p>
	<li>If no CPU thread is running, then &lsquo;Ctrl&ndash;C&rsquo; is not able to stop AMD GPU threads. This can happen for example if you enable scheduler&ndash;locking after the whole program stopped, and then resume an AMD GPU thread. The only way to unblock the situation is to kill the GDB process.</li>
	<li>By default, for some architectures, the AMD GPU device driver causes all AMD GPU wavefronts created when GDB is not attached to be unable to report the dispatch associated with the wavefront, or the wavefront&rsquo;s work&ndash;group position. The &lsquo;info threads&rsquo; command will display this missing information with a &lsquo;?&rsquo;.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This does not affect wavefronts created while GDB is attached which are always capable of reporting this information.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the HSA_ENABLE_DEBUG environment variable is set to &lsquo;1&rsquo; when the AMD ROCm runtime is initialized, then this information will be available for all architectures even for wavefronts created when GDB was not attached.

	<H2><a name="HEAD_7d2e3841" href="#TOC_HEAD_7d2e3841">22.1 Prompt</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB indicates its readiness to read a command by printing a string called the prompt. This string is normally &lsquo;(gdb)&rsquo;. You can change the prompt string with the set prompt command. For instance, when debugging GDB with GDB, it is useful to change the prompt in one of the GDB sessions so that you can always tell which one you are talking to.
</p>
<p>
	Note: set prompt does not add a space for you after the prompt you set. This allows you to set a prompt which ends in a space or a prompt that does not.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set prompt newprompt</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Directs GDB to use newprompt as its prompt string henceforth.
	</p>
	<li>show prompt</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Prints a line of the form: &lsquo;Gdb&#039;s prompt is: your&ndash;prompt&rsquo;
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Versions of GDB that ship with Python scripting enabled have prompt extensions. The commands for interacting with these extensions are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set extended&ndash;prompt prompt</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set an extended prompt that allows for substitutions. See gdb.prompt, for a list of escape sequences that can be used for substitution. Any escape sequences specified as part of the prompt string are replaced with the corresponding strings each time the prompt is displayed.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>set extended-prompt Current working directory: \w (gdb)	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note that when an extended&ndash;prompt is set, it takes control of the prompt_hook hook. See prompt_hook, for further information.
	</p>
	<li>show extended&ndash;prompt</li>

	<H2><a name="HEAD_324ef567" href="#TOC_HEAD_324ef567">22.2 Command Editing</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB reads its input commands via the Readline interface. This GNU library provides consistent behavior for programs which provide a command line interface to the user. Advantages are GNU Emacs&ndash;style or vi&ndash;style inline editing of commands, csh&ndash;like history substitution, and a storage and recall of command history across debugging sessions.
</p>
<p>
	You may control the behavior of command line editing in GDB with the command set.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set editing</li>
	<li>set editing on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable command line editing (enabled by default).
	</p>
	<li>set editing off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable command line editing.
	</p>
	<li>show editing</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether command line editing is enabled.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	See Command Line Editing, for more details about the Readline interface. Users unfamiliar with GNU Emacs or vi are encouraged to read that chapter.
</p>
<p>
	GDB sets the Readline application name to &lsquo;gdb&rsquo;. This is useful for conditions in .inputrc.
</p>
<p>
	GDB defines a bindable Readline command, operate&ndash;and&ndash;get&ndash;next. This is bound to C&ndash;o by default. This command accepts the current line for execution and fetches the next line relative to the current line from the history for editing. Any argument is ignored.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_2ac0c264" href="#TOC_HEAD_2ac0c264">22.3 Command History</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB can keep track of the commands you type during your debugging sessions, so that you can be certain of precisely what happened. Use these commands to manage the GDB command history facility.
</p>
<p>
	GDB uses the GNU History library, a part of the Readline package, to provide the history facility. See Using History Interactively, for the detailed description of the History library.
</p>
<p>
	To issue a command to GDB without affecting certain aspects of the state which is seen by users, prefix it with &lsquo;server &rsquo; (see Server Prefix). This means that this command will not affect the command history, nor will it affect GDB&rsquo;s notion of which command to repeat if RET is pressed on a line by itself.
</p>
<p>
	The server prefix does not affect the recording of values into the value history; to print a value without recording it into the value history, use the output command instead of the print command.
</p>
<p>
	Here is the description of GDB commands related to command history.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set history filename [fname]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the name of the GDB command history file to fname. This is the file where GDB reads an initial command history list, and where it writes the command history from this session when it exits. You can access this list through history expansion or through the history command editing characters listed below. This file defaults to the value of the environment variable GDBHISTFILE, or to ./.gdb_history (./_gdb_history on MS&ndash;DOS) if this variable is not set.
	</p>
	<p>
		The GDBHISTFILE environment variable is read after processing any GDB initialization files (see Startup) and after processing any commands passed using command line options (for example, &ndash;ex).
	</p>
	<p>
		If the fname argument is not given, or if the GDBHISTFILE is the empty string then GDB will neither try to load an existing history file, nor will it try to save the history on exit.
	</p>
	<li>set history save</li>
	<li>set history save on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Record command history in a file, whose name may be specified with the set history filename command. By default, this option is disabled. The command history will be recorded when GDB exits. If set history filename is set to the empty string then history saving is disabled, even when set history save is on.
	</p>
	<li>set history save off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Don&rsquo;t record the command history into the file specified by set history filename when GDB exits.
	</p>
	<li>set history size size</li>
	<li>set history size unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the number of commands which GDB keeps in its history list. This defaults to the value of the environment variable GDBHISTSIZE, or to 256 if this variable is not set. Non&ndash;numeric values of GDBHISTSIZE are ignored. If size is unlimited or if GDBHISTSIZE is either a negative number or the empty string, then the number of commands GDB keeps in the history list is unlimited.
	</p>
	<p>
		The GDBHISTSIZE environment variable is read after processing any GDB initialization files (see Startup) and after processing any commands passed using command line options (for example, &ndash;ex).
	</p>
	<li>set history remove&ndash;duplicates count</li>
	<li>set history remove&ndash;duplicates unlimited</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the removal of duplicate history entries in the command history list. If count is non&ndash;zero, GDB will look back at the last count history entries and remove the first entry that is a duplicate of the current entry being added to the command history list. If count is unlimited then this lookbehind is unbounded. If count is 0, then removal of duplicate history entries is disabled.
	</p>
	<p>
		Only history entries added during the current session are considered for removal. This option is set to 0 by default.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	History expansion assigns special meaning to the character !. See Event Designators, for more details.
</p>
<p>
	Since ! is also the logical not operator in C, history expansion is off by default. If you decide to enable history expansion with the set history expansion on command, you may sometimes need to follow ! (when it is used as logical not, in an expression) with a space or a tab to prevent it from being expanded. The readline history facilities do not attempt substitution on the strings != and !(, even when history expansion is enabled.
</p>
<p>
	The commands to control history expansion are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set history expansion on</li>
	<li>set history expansion</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable history expansion. History expansion is off by default.
	</p>
	<li>set history expansion off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable history expansion.
	</p>
	<li>show history</li>
	<li>show history filename</li>
	<li>show history save</li>
	<li>show history size</li>
	<li>show history expansion</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These commands display the state of the GDB history parameters. show history by itself displays all four states.
	</p>
	<li>show commands</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the last ten commands in the command history.
	</p>
	<li>show commands n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print ten commands centered on command number n.
	</p>
	<li>show commands +</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print ten commands just after the commands last printed.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_f755de1b" href="#TOC_HEAD_f755de1b">22.4 Screen Size</a></H2>
<p>
	Certain commands to GDB may produce large amounts of information output to the screen. To help you read all of it, GDB pauses and asks you for input at the end of each page of output. Type RET when you want to see one more page of output, q to discard the remaining output, or c to continue without paging for the rest of the current command. Also, the screen width setting determines when to wrap lines of output. Depending on what is being printed, GDB tries to break the line at a readable place, rather than simply letting it overflow onto the following line.
</p>
<p>
	Normally GDB knows the size of the screen from the terminal driver software. For example, on Unix GDB uses the termcap data base together with the value of the TERM environment variable and the stty rows and stty cols settings. If this is not correct, you can override it with the set height and set width commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set height lpp</li>
	<li>set height unlimited</li>
	<li>show height</li>
	<li>set width cpl</li>
	<li>set width unlimited</li>
	<li>show width</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These set commands specify a screen height of lpp lines and a screen width of cpl characters. The associated show commands display the current settings.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you specify a height of either unlimited or zero lines, GDB does not pause during output no matter how long the output is. This is useful if output is to a file or to an editor buffer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Likewise, you can specify &lsquo;set width unlimited&rsquo; or &lsquo;set width 0&rsquo; to prevent GDB from wrapping its output.
	</p>
	<li>set pagination on</li>
	<li>set pagination off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Turn the output pagination on or off; the default is on. Turning pagination off is the alternative to set height unlimited. Note that running GDB with the &ndash;&ndash;batch option (see &ndash;batch) also automatically disables pagination.
	</p>
	<li>show pagination</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current pagination mode.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_16f77748" href="#TOC_HEAD_16f77748">22.5 Output Styling</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB can style its output on a capable terminal. This is enabled by default on most systems, but disabled by default when in batch mode (see Mode Options). Various style settings are available; and styles can also be disabled entirely.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set style enabled &lsquo;on|off&rsquo;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable or disable all styling. The default is host&ndash;dependent, with most hosts defaulting to &lsquo;on&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>show style enabled</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of styling.
	</p>
	<li>set style sources &lsquo;on|off&rsquo;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable or disable source code styling. This affects whether source code, such as the output of the list command, is styled. The default is &lsquo;on&rsquo;. Note that source styling only works if styling in general is enabled, and if a source highlighting library is available to GDB.

	<p>
		There are two ways that highlighting can be done. First, if GDB was linked with the GNU Source Highlight library, then it is used. Otherwise, if GDB was configured with Python scripting support, and if the Python Pygments package is available, then it will be used.
	</p>
	<li>show style sources</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of source code styling.
	</p>
	<li>set style tui&ndash;current&ndash;position &lsquo;on|off&rsquo;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable or disable styling of the source and assembly code highlighted by the TUI&rsquo;s current position indicator. The default is &lsquo;off&rsquo;. See GDB Text User Interface.
	</p>
	<li>show style tui&ndash;current&ndash;position</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether the source and assembly code highlighted by the TUI&rsquo;s current position indicator is styled.
	</p>
	<li>set style disassembler enabled &lsquo;on|off&rsquo;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable or disable disassembler styling. This affects whether disassembler output, such as the output of the disassemble command, is styled. Disassembler styling only works if styling in general is enabled (with set style enabled on), and if a source highlighting library is available to GDB.
	</p>
	<p>
		The two source highlighting libraries that GDB could use to style disassembler output are; GDB&rsquo;s builtin disassembler, or the Python Pygments package.
	</p>
	<p>
		GDB&rsquo;s first choice will be to use the builtin disassembler for styling, this usually provides better results, being able to style different types of instruction operands differently. However, the builtin disassembler is not able to style all architectures.
	</p>
	<p>
		For architectures that the builtin disassembler is unable to style, GDB will fall back to use the Python Pygments package where possible. In order to use the Python Pygments package, GDB must be built with Python support, and the Pygments package must be installed.
	</p>
	<p>
		If neither of these options are available then GDB will produce unstyled disassembler output, even when this setting is &lsquo;on&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		To discover if the current architecture supports styling using the builtin disassembler library see maint show libopcodes&ndash;styling enabled.
	</p>
	<li>show style disassembler enabled</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of disassembler styling.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Subcommands of set style control specific forms of styling. These subcommands all follow the same pattern: each style&ndash;able object can be styled with a foreground color, a background color, and an intensity.
</p>
<p>
	For example, the style of file names can be controlled using the set style filename group of commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set style filename background color</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the background to color. Valid colors are &lsquo;none&rsquo; (meaning the terminal&rsquo;s default color), &lsquo;black&rsquo;, &lsquo;red&rsquo;, &lsquo;green&rsquo;, &lsquo;yellow&rsquo;, &lsquo;blue&rsquo;, &lsquo;magenta&rsquo;, &lsquo;cyan&rsquo;, and&lsquo;white&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>set style filename foreground color</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the foreground to color. Valid colors are &lsquo;none&rsquo; (meaning the terminal&rsquo;s default color), &lsquo;black&rsquo;, &lsquo;red&rsquo;, &lsquo;green&rsquo;, &lsquo;yellow&rsquo;, &lsquo;blue&rsquo;, &lsquo;magenta&rsquo;, &lsquo;cyan&rsquo;, and&lsquo;white&rsquo;.
	</p>
	<li>set style filename intensity value</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the intensity to value. Valid intensities are &lsquo;normal&rsquo; (the default), &lsquo;bold&rsquo;, and &lsquo;dim&rsquo;.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The show style command and its subcommands are styling a style name in their output using its own style. So, use show style to see the complete list of styles, their characteristics and the visual aspect of each style.
</p>
<p>
	The style&ndash;able objects are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of file names and URLs. By default, this style&rsquo;s foreground color is green.
	</p>
	<li>function</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of function names. These are managed with the set style function family of commands. By default, this style&rsquo;s foreground color is yellow.
	</p>
	<p>
		This style is also used for symbol names in styled disassembler output if GDB is using its builtin disassembler library for styling (see set style disassembler enabled).
	</p>
	<li>variable</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of variable names. These are managed with the set style variable family of commands. By default, this style&rsquo;s foreground color is cyan.
	</p>
	<li>address</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of addresses. These are managed with the set style address family of commands. By default, this style&rsquo;s foreground color is blue.
	</p>
	<p>
		This style is also used for addresses in styled disassembler output if GDB is using its builtin disassembler library for styling (see set style disassembler enabled).
	</p>
	<li>version</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of GDB&rsquo;s version number text. By default, this style&rsquo;s foreground color is magenta and it has bold intensity. The version number is displayed in two places, the output of show version, and when GDB starts up.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to control how GDB styles the version number at startup, add the set style version family of commands to the early initialization command file (see Initialization Files).
	</p>
	<li>title</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of titles. These are managed with the set style title family of commands. By default, this style&rsquo;s intensity is bold. Commands are using the title style to improve the readability of large output. For example, the commands apropos and help are using the title style for the command names.
	</p>
	<li>highlight</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of highlightings. These are managed with the set style highlight family of commands. By default, this style&rsquo;s foreground color is red. Commands are using the highlight style to draw the user attention to some specific parts of their output. For example, the command apropos &ndash;v REGEXP uses the highlight style to mark the documentation parts matching regexp.
	</p>
	<li>metadata</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of data annotations added by GDB to data it displays. By default, this style&rsquo;s intensity is dim. Metadata annotations include the &lsquo;repeats n times&rsquo; annotation for suppressed display of repeated array elements (see Print Settings), &lsquo;&lt;unavailable&gt;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lt;error descr&gt;&rsquo; annotations for errors and &lsquo;&lt;optimized&ndash;out&gt;&rsquo; annotations for optimized&ndash;out values in displaying stack frame information in backtraces (see Backtrace), etc.
	</p>
	<li>tui&ndash;border</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of the TUI border. Note that, unlike other styling options, only the color of the border can be controlled via set style. This was done for compatibility reasons, as TUI controls to set the border&rsquo;s intensity predated the addition of general styling to GDB. See TUI Configuration.
	</p>
	<li>tui&ndash;active&ndash;border</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of the active TUI border; that is, the TUI window that has the focus.
	</p>
	<li>disassembler comment</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of comments in the disassembler output. These are managed with the set style disassembler comment family of commands. This style is only used when GDB is styling using its builtin disassembler library (see set style disassembler enabled). By default, this style&rsquo;s intensity is dim, and its foreground color is white.
	</p>
	<li>disassembler immediate</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of numeric operands in the disassembler output. These are managed with the set style disassembler immediate family of commands. This style is not used for instruction operands that represent addresses, in that case the &lsquo;disassembler address&rsquo; style is used. This style is only used when GDB is styling using its builtin disassembler library. By default, this style&rsquo;s foreground color is blue.
	</p>
	<li>disassembler address</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of address operands in the disassembler output. This is an alias for the &lsquo;address&rsquo; style.
	</p>
	<li>disassembler symbol</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of symbol names in the disassembler output. This is an alias for the &lsquo;function&rsquo; style.
	</p>
	<li>disassembler mnemonic</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of instruction mnemonics in the disassembler output. These are managed with the set style disassembler mnemonic family of commands. This style is also used for assembler directives, e.g. .byte, .word, etc. This style is only used when GDB is styling using its builtin disassembler library. By default, this style&rsquo;s foreground color is green.
	</p>
	<li>disassembler register</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Control the styling of register operands in the disassembler output. These are managed with the set style disassembler register family of commands. This style is only used when GDB is styling using its builtin disassembler library. By default, this style&rsquo;s foreground color is red.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_a91fb612" href="#TOC_HEAD_a91fb612">22.6 Numbers</a></H2>
<p>
	You can always enter numbers in octal, decimal, or hexadecimal in GDB by the usual conventions: octal numbers begin with &lsquo;0&rsquo;, decimal numbers end with &lsquo;.&rsquo;, and hexadecimal numbers begin with &lsquo;0x&rsquo;. Numbers that neither begin with &lsquo;0&rsquo; or &lsquo;0x&rsquo;, nor end with a &lsquo;.&rsquo; are, by default, entered in base 10; likewise, the default display for numbers&mdash;when no particular format is specified&mdash;is base 10. You can change the default base for both input and output with the commands described below.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set input&ndash;radix base</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the default base for numeric input. Supported choices for base are decimal 8, 10, or 16. The base must itself be specified either unambiguously or using the current input radix; for example, any of
	</p>
	<pre><code>set input-radix 012
set input-radix 10.
set input-radix 0xa	</code></pre>
	<p>
		sets the input base to decimal. On the other hand, &lsquo;set input&ndash;radix 10&rsquo; leaves the input radix unchanged, no matter what it was, since &lsquo;10&rsquo;, being without any leading or trailing signs of its base, is interpreted in the current radix. Thus, if the current radix is 16, &lsquo;10&rsquo; is interpreted in hex, i.e. as 16 decimal, which doesn&rsquo;t change the radix.
	</p>
	<li>set output&ndash;radix base</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the default base for numeric display. Supported choices for base are decimal 8, 10, or 16. The base must itself be specified either unambiguously or using the current input radix.
	</p>
	<li>show input&ndash;radix</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current default base for numeric input.
	</p>
	<li>show output&ndash;radix</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current default base for numeric display.
	</p>
	<li>set radix [base]</li>
	<li>show radix</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		These commands set and show the default base for both input and output of numbers. set radix sets the radix of input and output to the same base; without an argument, it resets the radix back to its default value of 10.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_c9e0a01e" href="#TOC_HEAD_c9e0a01e">22.7 Configuring the Current ABI</a></H2>
<p>
	GDB can determine the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of your application automatically. However, sometimes you need to override its conclusions. Use these commands to manage GDB&rsquo;s view of the current ABI.
</p>
<p>
	One GDB configuration can debug binaries for multiple operating system targets, either via remote debugging or native emulation. GDB will autodetect the OS ABI (Operating System ABI) in use, but you can override its conclusion using the set osabi command. One example where this is useful is in debugging of binaries which use an alternate C library (e.g. UCLIBC for GNU/Linux) which does not have the same identifying marks that the standard C library for your platform provides.
</p>
<p>
	When GDB is debugging the AArch64 architecture, it provides a &ldquo;Newlib&rdquo; OS ABI. This is useful for handling setjmp and longjmp when debugging binaries that use the NEWLIB C library. The &ldquo;Newlib&rdquo; OS ABI can be selected by set osabi Newlib.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>show osabi</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the OS ABI currently in use.
	</p>
	<li>set osabi</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		With no argument, show the list of registered available OS ABI&rsquo;s.
	</p>
	<li>set osabi abi</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the current OS ABI to abi.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Generally, the way that an argument of type float is passed to a function depends on whether the function is prototyped. For a prototyped (i.e. ANSI/ISO style) function, float arguments are passed unchanged, according to the architecture&rsquo;s convention for float. For unprototyped (i.e. K&amp;R style) functions, float arguments are first promoted to type double and then passed.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, some forms of debug information do not reliably indicate whether a function is prototyped. If GDB calls a function that is not marked as prototyped, it consults set coerce&ndash;float&ndash;to&ndash;double.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set coerce&ndash;float&ndash;to&ndash;double</li>
	<li>set coerce&ndash;float&ndash;to&ndash;double on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Arguments of type float will be promoted to double when passed to an unprototyped function. This is the default setting.
	</p>
	<li>set coerce&ndash;float&ndash;to&ndash;double off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Arguments of type float will be passed directly to unprototyped functions.
	</p>
	<li>show coerce&ndash;float&ndash;to&ndash;double</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current setting of promoting float to double.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	GDB needs to know the ABI used for your program&rsquo;s C++ objects. The correct C++ ABI depends on which C++ compiler was used to build your application. GDB only fully supports programs with a single C++ ABI; if your program contains code using multiple C++ ABI&rsquo;s or if GDB can not identify your program&rsquo;s ABI correctly, you can tell GDB which ABI to use. Currently supported ABI&rsquo;s include &ldquo;gnu&ndash;v2&rdquo;, for g++ versions before 3.0, &ldquo;gnu&ndash;v3&rdquo;, for g++ versions 3.0 and later, and &ldquo;hpaCC&rdquo; for the HP ANSI C++ compiler. Other C++ compilers may use the &ldquo;gnu&ndash;v2&rdquo; or &ldquo;gnu&ndash;v3&rdquo; ABI&rsquo;s as well. The default setting is &ldquo;auto&rdquo;.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>show cp&ndash;abi</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the C++ ABI currently in use.
	</p>
	<li>set cp&ndash;abi</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		With no argument, show the list of supported C++ ABI&rsquo;s.
	</p>
	<li>set cp&ndash;abi abi</li>
	<li>set cp&ndash;abi auto</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the current C++ ABI to abi, or return to automatic detection.

<p>
	GDB sometimes reads files with commands and settings automatically, without being explicitly told so by the user. We call this feature auto&ndash;loading. While auto&ndash;loading is useful for automatically adapting GDB to the needs of your project, it can sometimes produce unexpected results or introduce security risks (e.g., if the file comes from untrusted sources).
</p>
<p>
	There are various kinds of files GDB can automatically load. In addition to these files, GDB supports auto&ndash;loading code written in various extension languages. See Auto&ndash;loading extensions.
</p>
<p>
	Note that loading of these associated files (including the local .gdbinit file) requires accordingly configured auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path (see Auto&ndash;loading safe path).
</p>
<p>
	For these reasons, GDB includes commands and options to let you control when to auto&ndash;load files and which files should be auto&ndash;loaded.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set auto&ndash;load off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Globally disable loading of all auto&ndash;loaded files. You may want to use this command with the &lsquo;&ndash;iex&rsquo; option (see Option &ndash;init&ndash;eval&ndash;command) such as:
	</p>
	<pre><code>$ gdb -iex "set auto-load off" untrusted-executable corefile	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Be aware that system init file (see System&ndash;wide configuration) and init files from your home directory (see Home Directory Init File) still get read (as they come from generally trusted directories). To prevent GDB from auto&ndash;loading even those init files, use the &ndash;nx option (see Mode Options), in addition to set auto&ndash;load no.
	</p>
	<li>show auto&ndash;load</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether auto&ndash;loading of each specific &lsquo;auto&ndash;load&rsquo; file(s) is enabled or disabled.
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) show auto-load
gdb-scripts:  Auto-loading of canned sequences of commands scripts is on.

                    is $debugdir:$datadir/auto-load.	</code></pre>
	<li>info auto&ndash;load</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print whether each specific &lsquo;auto&ndash;load&rsquo; file(s) have been auto&ndash;loaded or not.
	</p>

<p>
	This feature is currently present only on GNU/Linux native hosts.
</p>
<p>
	GDB reads in some cases thread debugging library from places specific to the inferior (see set libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path).
</p>
<p>
	The special &lsquo;libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; entry &lsquo;$sdir&rsquo; is processed without checking this &lsquo;set auto&ndash;load libthread&ndash;db&rsquo; switch as system libraries have to be trusted in general. In all other cases of &lsquo;libthread&ndash;db&ndash;search&ndash;path&rsquo; entries GDB checks first if &lsquo;set auto&ndash;load libthread&ndash;db&rsquo; is enabled before trying to open such thread debugging library.
</p>
<p>
	Note that loading of this debugging library also requires accordingly configured auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path (see Auto&ndash;loading safe path).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set auto&ndash;load libthread&ndash;db [on|off]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable or disable the auto&ndash;loading of inferior specific thread debugging library.
	</p>
	<li>show auto&ndash;load libthread&ndash;db</li>

	<p>
		Print the list of all loaded inferior specific thread debugging libraries and for each such library print list of inferior pids using it.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_ce5a0b98" href="#TOC_HEAD_ce5a0b98">22.8.3 Security restriction for auto&ndash;loading</a></H3>
<p>
	As the files of inferior can come from untrusted source (such as submitted by an application user) GDB does not always load any files automatically. GDB provides the &lsquo;set auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path&rsquo; setting to list directories trusted for loading files not explicitly requested by user. Each directory can also be a shell wildcard pattern.
</p>
<p>
	If the path is not set properly you will see a warning and the file will not get loaded:
</p>
<pre><code>$ ./gdb -q ./gdb
Reading symbols from /home/user/gdb/gdb...
warning: File "/home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.gdb" auto-loading has been
        declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set
        to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".
warning: File "/home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.py" auto-loading has been
        declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set
        to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".</code></pre>
<p>
	To instruct GDB to go ahead and use the init files anyway, invoke GDB like this:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb -q -iex "set auto-load safe-path /home/user/gdb" ./gdb</code></pre>
<p>
	The list of trusted directories is controlled by the following commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path [directories]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set the list of directories (and their subdirectories) trusted for automatic loading and execution of scripts. You can also enter a specific trusted file. Each directory can also be a shell wildcard pattern; wildcards do not match directory separator &ndash; see FNM_PATHNAME for system function fnmatch (see fnmatch in GNU C Library Reference Manual). If you omit directories, &lsquo;auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path&rsquo; will be reset to its default value as specified during GDB compilation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The list of directories uses path separator (&lsquo;:&rsquo; on GNU and Unix systems, &lsquo;;&rsquo; on MS&ndash;Windows and MS&ndash;DOS) to separate directories, similarly to the PATH environment variable.
	</p>
	<li>show auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the list of directories trusted for automatic loading and execution of scripts.
	</p>
	<li>add&ndash;auto&ndash;load&ndash;safe&ndash;path</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Add an entry (or list of entries) to the list of directories trusted for automatic loading and execution of scripts. Multiple entries may be delimited by the host platform path separator in use.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	This variable defaults to what &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;auto&ndash;load&ndash;dir has been configured to (see with&ndash;auto&ndash;load&ndash;dir). $debugdir and $datadir substitution applies the same as for set auto&ndash;load scripts&ndash;directory. The default set auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path value can be also overriden by GDB configuration option &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;auto&ndash;load&ndash;safe&ndash;path.
</p>
<p>
	Setting this variable to / disables this security protection, corresponding GDB configuration option is &ndash;&ndash;without&ndash;auto&ndash;load&ndash;safe&ndash;path. This variable is supposed to be set to the system directories writable by the system superuser only. Users can add their source directories in init files in their home directories (see Home Directory Init File). See also deprecated init file in the current directory (see Init File in the Current Directory during Startup).
</p>
<p>
	To force GDB to load the files it declined to load in the previous example, you could use one of the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>&tilde;/.gdbinit: &lsquo;add&ndash;auto&ndash;load&ndash;safe&ndash;path &tilde;/src/gdb&rsquo;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specify this trusted directory (or a file) as additional component of the list. You have to specify also any existing directories displayed by by &lsquo;show auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path&rsquo; (such as &lsquo;/usr:/bin&rsquo; in this example).
	</p>
	<li>gdb &ndash;iex &quot;set auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path /usr:/bin:&tilde;/src/gdb&quot; &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Specify this directory as in the previous case but just for a single GDB session.
	</p>
	<li>gdb &ndash;iex &quot;set auto&ndash;load safe&ndash;path /&quot; &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable auto&ndash;loading safety for a single GDB session. This assumes all the files you debug during this GDB session will come from trusted sources.
	</p>
	<li>./configure &ndash;&ndash;without&ndash;auto&ndash;load&ndash;safe&ndash;path</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		During compilation of GDB you may disable any auto&ndash;loading safety. This assumes all the files you will ever debug with this GDB come from trusted sources.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	On the other hand you can also explicitly forbid automatic files loading which also suppresses any such warning messages:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>gdb &ndash;iex &quot;set auto&ndash;load no&quot; &hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		You can use GDB command&ndash;line option for a single GDB session.
	</p>
	<li>&tilde;/.gdbinit: &lsquo;set auto&ndash;load no&rsquo;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable auto&ndash;loading globally for the user (see Home Directory Init File). While it is improbable, you could also use system init file instead (see System&ndash;wide configuration).
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	This setting applies to the file names as entered by user. If no entry matches GDB tries as a last resort to also resolve all the file names into their canonical form (typically resolving symbolic links) and compare the entries again. GDB already canonicalizes most of the filenames on its own before starting the comparison so a canonical form of directories is recommended to be entered.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_9d89411e" href="#TOC_HEAD_9d89411e">22.8.4 Displaying files tried for auto&ndash;load</a></H3>
<p>
	For better visibility of all the file locations where you can place scripts to be auto&ndash;loaded with inferior &mdash; or to protect yourself against accidental execution of untrusted scripts &mdash; GDB provides a feature for printing all the files attempted to be loaded. Both existing and non&ndash;existing files may be printed.
</p>
<p>
	For example the list of directories from which it is safe to auto&ndash;load files (see Auto&ndash;loading safe path) applies also to canonicalized filenames which may not be too obvious while setting it up.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) set debug auto-load on
(gdb) file ~/src/t/true

warning: File "/tmp/true-gdb.gdb" auto-loading has been declined
        by your `auto-load safe-path' set to "/usr:/opt".</code></pre>
<ul>
	<li>set debug auto&ndash;load [on|off]</li>

	<p>
		Set whether to print the filenames attempted to be auto&ndash;loaded.

	<H2><a name="HEAD_fc31fcb3" href="#TOC_HEAD_fc31fcb3">22.9 Optional Warnings and Messages</a></H2>
<p>
	By default, GDB is silent about its inner workings. If you are running on a slow machine, you may want to use the set verbose command. This makes GDB tell you when it does a lengthy internal operation, so you will not think it has crashed.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, the messages controlled by set verbose are those which announce that the symbol table for a source file is being read; see symbol&ndash;file in Commands to Specify Files.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set verbose on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enables GDB output of certain informational messages.
	</p>
	<li>set verbose off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disables GDB output of certain informational messages.
	</p>
	<li>show verbose</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays whether set verbose is on or off.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	By default, if GDB encounters bugs in the symbol table of an object file, it is silent; but if you are debugging a compiler, you may find this information useful (see Errors Reading Symbol Files).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set complaints limit</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Permits GDB to output limit complaints about each type of unusual symbols before becoming silent about the problem. Set limit to zero to suppress all complaints; set it to a large number to prevent complaints from being suppressed.
	</p>
	<li>show complaints</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays how many symbol complaints GDB is permitted to produce.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	By default, GDB is cautious, and asks what sometimes seems to be a lot of stupid questions to confirm certain commands. For example, if you try to run a program which is already running:
</p>
<p>
	(gdb) run
	The program being debugged has been started already.
	Start it from the beginning? (y or n)
</p>
<p>
	If you are willing to unflinchingly face the consequences of your own commands, you can disable this &ldquo;feature&rdquo;:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set confirm off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disables confirmation requests. Note that running GDB with the &ndash;&ndash;batch option (see &ndash;batch) also automatically disables confirmation requests.
	</p>
	<li>set confirm on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enables confirmation requests (the default).
	</p>
	<li>show confirm</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays state of confirmation requests.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	If you need to debug user&ndash;defined commands or sourced files you may find it useful to enable command tracing. In this mode each command will be printed as it is executed, prefixed with one or more &lsquo;+&rsquo; symbols, the quantity denoting the call depth of each command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set trace&ndash;commands on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Enable command tracing.
	</p>
	<li>set trace&ndash;commands off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disable command tracing.
	</p>
	<li>show trace&ndash;commands</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current state of command tracing.

	<p>
		Sets the maximum number of characters to display for each remote packet when set debug remote is on. This is useful to prevent GDB from displaying lengthy remote packets and polluting the console.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default value is 512, which means GDB will truncate each remote packet after 512 bytes.

	<p>
		Turns on or off display of debugging messages related to symbol lookup. The default is 0 (off). A value of 1 provides basic information. A value greater than 1 provides more verbose information.
	</p>
	<li>show debug symbol&ndash;lookup</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current state of symbol lookup debugging messages.
	</p>
	<li>set debug symfile</li>

</ul>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_22f91dd7" href="#TOC_HEAD_22f91dd7">22.11 Other Miscellaneous Settings</a></H2>
<ul>
	<li>set interactive&ndash;mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If on, forces GDB to assume that GDB was started in a terminal. In practice, this means that GDB should wait for the user to answer queries generated by commands entered at the command prompt. If off, forces GDB to operate in the opposite mode, and it uses the default answers to all queries. If auto (the default), GDB tries to determine whether its standard input is a terminal, and works in interactive&ndash;mode if it is, non&ndash;interactively otherwise.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the vast majority of cases, the debugger should be able to guess correctly which mode should be used. But this setting can be useful in certain specific cases, such as running a MinGW GDB inside a cygwin window.
	</p>
	<li>show interactive&ndash;mode</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays whether the debugger is operating in interactive mode or not.
	</p>
	<li>set suppress&ndash;cli&ndash;notifications</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		If on, command&ndash;line&ndash;interface (CLI) notifications that are printed by GDB are suppressed. If off, the notifications are printed as usual. The default value is off. CLI notifications occur when you change the selected context or when the program being debugged stops, as detailed below.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>User&ndash;selected context changes:</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			When you change the selected context (i.e. the current inferior, thread and/or the frame), GDB prints information about the new context. For example, the default behavior is below:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) inferior 1
[Switching to inferior 1 [process 634] (/tmp/test)]
[Switching to thread 1 (process 634)]
#0  main () at test.c:3
3         return 0;
(gdb)		</code></pre>
		<p>
			When the notifications are suppressed, the new context is not printed:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) set suppress-cli-notifications on
(gdb) inferior 1
(gdb)		</code></pre>
		<li>The program being debugged stops:</li>
		<br />
		<p>
			When the program you are debugging stops (e.g. because of hitting a breakpoint, completing source&ndash;stepping, an interrupt, etc.), GDB prints information about the stop event. For example, below is a breakpoint hit:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) break test.c:3
Breakpoint 2 at 0x555555555155: file test.c, line 3.
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, main () at test.c:3
3         return 0;
(gdb)		</code></pre>
		<p>
			When the notifications are suppressed, the output becomes:
		</p>
		<pre><code>(gdb) break test.c:3
Breakpoint 2 at 0x555555555155: file test.c, line 3.
(gdb) set suppress-cli-notifications on
(gdb) continue
Continuing.
(gdb)		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Suppressing CLI notifications may be useful in scripts to obtain a reduced output from a list of commands.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li>show suppress&ndash;cli&ndash;notifications</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Displays whether printing CLI notifications is suppressed or not.

</ul>
	<H1><a name="HEAD_ab5949ae" href="#TOC_HEAD_ab5949ae">23 Extending GDB</a></H1>
<p>
	GDB provides several mechanisms for extension. GDB also provides the ability to automatically load extensions when it reads a file for debugging. This allows the user to automatically customize GDB for the program being debugged.
</p>
<p>
	To facilitate the use of extension languages, GDB is capable of evaluating the contents of a file. When doing so, GDB can recognize which extension language is being used by looking at the filename extension. Files with an unrecognized filename extension are always treated as a GDB Command Files. See Command files.
</p>
<p>
	You can control how GDB evaluates these files with the following setting:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set script&ndash;extension off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		All scripts are always evaluated as GDB Command Files.
	</p>
	<li>set script&ndash;extension soft</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The debugger determines the scripting language based on filename extension. If this scripting language is supported, GDB evaluates the script using that language. Otherwise, it evaluates the file as a GDB Command File.
	</p>
	<li>set script&ndash;extension strict</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The debugger determines the scripting language based on filename extension, and evaluates the script using that language. If the language is not supported, then the evaluation fails.
	</p>
	<li>show script&ndash;extension</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current value of the script&ndash;extension option.
	</p>

</menu>

</div>
<p>
	Aside from breakpoint commands (see Breakpoint Command Lists), GDB provides two ways to store sequences of commands for execution as a unit: user&ndash;defined commands and command files.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_beb08da8" href="#TOC_HEAD_beb08da8">23.1.1 User&ndash;defined Commands</a></H3>
<p>
	A user&ndash;defined command is a sequence of GDB commands to which you assign a new name as a command. This is done with the define command. User commands may accept an unlimited number of arguments separated by whitespace. Arguments are accessed within the user command via $arg0&hellip;$argN. A trivial example:
</p>
<pre><code>define adder
print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
end</code></pre>
<p>
	To execute the command use:
</p>
<pre><code>adder 1 2 3</code></pre>
<p>
	This defines the command adder, which prints the sum of its three arguments. Note the arguments are text substitutions, so they may reference variables, use complex expressions, or even perform inferior functions calls.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, $argc may be used to find out how many arguments have been passed.
</p>
<pre><code>define adder
if $argc == 2
    print $arg0 + $arg1
end
if $argc == 3
    print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
end
end</code></pre>
<p>
	Combining with the eval command (see eval) makes it easier to process a variable number of arguments:
</p>
<pre><code>define adder
set $i = 0
set $sum = 0
while $i &lt; $argc
    eval "set $sum = $sum + $arg%d", $i
    set $i = $i + 1
end
print $sum
end</code></pre>
<ul>
	<li>define commandname</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Define a command named commandname. If there is already a command by that name, you are asked to confirm that you want to redefine it. The argument commandname may be a bare command name consisting of letters, numbers, dashes, dots, and underscores. It may also start with any predefined or user&ndash;defined prefix command. For example, &lsquo;define target my&ndash;target&rsquo; creates a user&ndash;defined &lsquo;target my&ndash;target&rsquo; command.
	</p>
	<p>
		The definition of the command is made up of other GDB command lines, which are given following the define command. The end of these commands is marked by a line containing end.
	</p>
	<li>document commandname</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Document the user&ndash;defined command commandname, so that it can be accessed by help. The command commandname must already be defined. This command reads lines of documentation just as define reads the lines of the command definition, ending with end. After the document command is finished, help on command commandname displays the documentation you have written.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may use the document command again to change the documentation of a command. Redefining the command with define does not change the documentation.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is also possible to document user&ndash;defined aliases. The alias documentation will then be used by the help and apropos commands instead of the documentation of the aliased command. Documenting a user&ndash;defined alias is particularly useful when defining an alias as a set of nested with commands (see Command aliases default args).
	</p>
	<li>define&ndash;prefix commandname</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Define or mark the command commandname as a user&ndash;defined prefix command. Once marked, commandname can be used as prefix command by the define command. Note that define&ndash;prefix can be used with a not yet defined commandname. In such a case, commandname is defined as an empty user&ndash;defined command. In case you redefine a command that was marked as a user&ndash;defined prefix command, the subcommands of the redefined command are kept (and GDB indicates so to the user).
	</p>
	<p>
		Example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) define-prefix abc
(gdb) define-prefix abc def
(gdb) define abc def
Type commands for definition of "abc def".
End with a line saying just "end".
&gt;echo command initial def\n
&gt;end
(gdb) define abc def ghi
Type commands for definition of "abc def ghi".
End with a line saying just "end".
&gt;echo command ghi\n
&gt;end
(gdb) define abc def
Keeping subcommands of prefix command "def".
Redefine command "def"? (y or n) y
Type commands for definition of "abc def".
End with a line saying just "end".
&gt;echo command def\n
&gt;end
(gdb) abc def ghi
command ghi
(gdb) abc def
command def
(gdb)	</code></pre>
	<li>dont&ndash;repeat</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Used inside a user&ndash;defined command, this tells GDB that this command should not be repeated when the user hits RET (see repeat last command).
	</p>
	<li>help user&ndash;defined</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		List all user&ndash;defined commands and all python commands defined in class COMMAND_USER. The first line of the documentation or docstring is included (if any).
	</p>
	<li>show user</li>
	<li>show user commandname</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the GDB commands used to define commandname (but not its documentation). If no commandname is given, display the definitions for all user&ndash;defined commands. This does not work for user&ndash;defined python commands.
	</p>
	<li>show max&ndash;user&ndash;call&ndash;depth</li>
	<li>set max&ndash;user&ndash;call&ndash;depth</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The value of max&ndash;user&ndash;call&ndash;depth controls how many recursion levels are allowed in user&ndash;defined commands before GDB suspects an infinite recursion and aborts the command. This does not apply to user&ndash;defined python commands.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	In addition to the above commands, user&ndash;defined commands frequently use control flow commands, described in Command Files.
</p>
<p>
	When user&ndash;defined commands are executed, the commands of the definition are not printed. An error in any command stops execution of the user&ndash;defined command.
</p>
<p>
	If used interactively, commands that would ask for confirmation proceed without asking when used inside a user&ndash;defined command. Many GDB commands that normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the messages when used in a user&ndash;defined command.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_10a746ba" href="#TOC_HEAD_10a746ba">23.1.2 User&ndash;defined Command Hooks</a></H3>
<p>
	You may define hooks, which are a special kind of user&ndash;defined command. Whenever you run the command &lsquo;foo&rsquo;, if the user&ndash;defined command &lsquo;hook&ndash;foo&rsquo; exists, it is executed (with no arguments) before that command.
</p>
<p>
	A hook may also be defined which is run after the command you executed. Whenever you run the command &lsquo;foo&rsquo;, if the user&ndash;defined command &lsquo;hookpost&ndash;foo&rsquo; exists, it is executed (with no arguments) after that command. Post&ndash;execution hooks may exist simultaneously with pre&ndash;execution hooks, for the same command.
</p>
<p>
	It is valid for a hook to call the command which it hooks. If this occurs, the hook is not re&ndash;executed, thereby avoiding infinite recursion.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, a pseudo&ndash;command, &lsquo;stop&rsquo; exists. Defining (&lsquo;hook&ndash;stop&rsquo;) makes the associated commands execute every time execution stops in your program: before breakpoint commands are run, displays are printed, or the stack frame is printed.
</p>
<p>
	For example, to ignore SIGALRM signals while single&ndash;stepping, but treat them normally during normal execution, you could define:
</p>
<pre><code>define hook-stop
handle SIGALRM nopass
end

define hook-run
handle SIGALRM pass
end

define hook-continue
handle SIGALRM pass
end</code></pre>
<p>
	As a further example, to hook at the beginning and end of the echo command, and to add extra text to the beginning and end of the message, you could define:
</p>
<pre><code>define hook-echo
echo &lt;&lt;&lt;---
end

define hookpost-echo
echo ---&gt;&gt;&gt;\n
end

(gdb) echo Hello World
&lt;&lt;&lt;---Hello World---&gt;&gt;&gt;
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	You can define a hook for any single&ndash;word command in GDB, but not for command aliases; you should define a hook for the basic command name, e.g. backtrace rather than bt. You can hook a multi&ndash;word command by adding hook&ndash; or hookpost&ndash; to the last word of the command, e.g. &lsquo;define target hook&ndash;remote&rsquo; to add a hook to &lsquo;target remote&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
	If an error occurs during the execution of your hook, execution of GDB commands stops and GDB issues a prompt (before the command that you actually typed had a chance to run).
</p>
<p>
	If you try to define a hook which does not match any known command, you get a warning from the define command.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_8428bdcb" href="#TOC_HEAD_8428bdcb">23.1.3 Command Files</a></H3>
<p>
	A command file for GDB is a text file made of lines that are GDB commands. Comments (lines starting with #) may also be included. An empty line in a command file does nothing; it does not mean to repeat the last command, as it would from the terminal.
</p>
<p>
	You can request the execution of a command file with the source command. Note that the source command is also used to evaluate scripts that are not Command Files. The exact behavior can be configured using the script&ndash;extension setting. See Extending GDB.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>source [&ndash;s] [&ndash;v] filename</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execute the command file filename.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The lines in a command file are generally executed sequentially, unless the order of execution is changed by one of the flow&ndash;control commands described below. The commands are not printed as they are executed. An error in any command terminates execution of the command file and control is returned to the console.
</p>
<p>
	GDB first searches for filename in the current directory. If the file is not found there, and filename does not specify a directory, then GDB also looks for the file on the source search path (specified with the &lsquo;directory&rsquo; command); except that $cdir is not searched because the compilation directory is not relevant to scripts.
</p>
<p>
	If &ndash;s is specified, then GDB searches for filename on the search path even if filename specifies a directory. The search is done by appending filename to each element of the search path. So, for example, if filename is mylib/myscript and the search path contains /home/user then GDB will look for the script /home/user/mylib/myscript. The search is also done if filename is an absolute path. For example, if filename is /tmp/myscript and the search path contains /home/user then GDB will look for the script /home/user/tmp/myscript. For DOS&ndash;like systems, if filename contains a drive specification, it is stripped before concatenation. For example, if filename is d:myscript and the search path contains c:/tmp then GDB will look for the script c:/tmp/myscript.
</p>
<p>
	If &ndash;v, for verbose mode, is given then GDB displays each command as it is executed. The option must be given before filename, and is interpreted as part of the filename anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
	Commands that would ask for confirmation if used interactively proceed without asking when used in a command file. Many GDB commands that normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the messages when called from command files.
</p>
<p>
	GDB also accepts command input from standard input. In this mode, normal output goes to standard output and error output goes to standard error. Errors in a command file supplied on standard input do not terminate execution of the command file&mdash;execution continues with the next command.
</p>
<pre><code>gdb &lt; cmds &gt; log 2&gt;&1</code></pre>
<p>
	(The syntax above will vary depending on the shell used.) This example will execute commands from the file cmds. All output and errors would be directed to log.
</p>
<p>
	Since commands stored on command files tend to be more general than commands typed interactively, they frequently need to deal with complicated situations, such as different or unexpected values of variables and symbols, changes in how the program being debugged is built, etc. GDB provides a set of flow&ndash;control commands to deal with these complexities. Using these commands, you can write complex scripts that loop over data structures, execute commands conditionally, etc.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>if</li>
	<li>else</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command allows to include in your script conditionally executed commands. The if command takes a single argument, which is an expression to evaluate. It is followed by a series of commands that are executed only if the expression is true (its value is nonzero). There can then optionally be an else line, followed by a series of commands that are only executed if the expression was false. The end of the list is marked by a line containing end.
	</p>
	<li>while</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command allows to write loops. Its syntax is similar to if: the command takes a single argument, which is an expression to evaluate, and must be followed by the commands to execute, one per line, terminated by an end. These commands are called the body of the loop. The commands in the body of while are executed repeatedly as long as the expression evaluates to true.
	</p>
	<li>loop_break</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command exits the while loop in whose body it is included. Execution of the script continues after that whiles end line.
	</p>
	<li>loop_continue</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This command skips the execution of the rest of the body of commands in the while loop in whose body it is included. Execution branches to the beginning of the while loop, where it evaluates the controlling expression.
	</p>
	<li>end</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Terminate the block of commands that are the body of if, else, or while flow&ndash;control commands.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_52dc851a" href="#TOC_HEAD_52dc851a">23.1.4 Commands for Controlled Output</a></H3>
<p>
	During the execution of a command file or a user&ndash;defined command, normal GDB output is suppressed; the only output that appears is what is explicitly printed by the commands in the definition. This section describes three commands useful for generating exactly the output you want.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>echo text</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print text. Nonprinting characters can be included in text using C escape sequences, such as &lsquo;\n&rsquo; to print a newline. No newline is printed unless you specify one. In addition to the standard C escape sequences, a backslash followed by a space stands for a space. This is useful for displaying a string with spaces at the beginning or the end, since leading and trailing spaces are otherwise trimmed from all arguments. To print &lsquo; and foo = &rsquo;, use the command &lsquo;echo \ and foo = \ &rsquo;.
	</p>
	<p>
		A backslash at the end of text can be used, as in C, to continue the command onto subsequent lines. For example,
	</p>
	<pre><code>echo This is some text\n\
which is continued\n\
onto several lines.\n	</code></pre>
	<p>
		produces the same output as
	</p>
	<pre><code>echo This is some text\n
echo which is continued\n
echo onto several lines.\n	</code></pre>
	<li>output expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the value of expression and nothing but that value: no newlines, no &lsquo;$nn = &rsquo;. The value is not entered in the value history either. See Expressions, for more information on expressions.
	</p>
	<li>output/fmt expression</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the value of expression in format fmt. You can use the same formats as for print. See Output Formats, for more information.
	</p>
	<li>printf template, expressions&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Print the values of one or more expressions under the control of the string template. To print several values, make expressions be a comma&ndash;separated list of individual expressions, which may be either numbers or pointers. Their values are printed as specified by template, exactly as a C program would do by executing the code below:
	</p>
	<pre><code>printf (template, expressions…);	</code></pre>
	<p>
		As in C printf, ordinary characters in template are printed verbatim, while conversion specification introduced by the &lsquo;%&rsquo; character cause subsequent expressions to be evaluated, their values converted and formatted according to type and style information encoded in the conversion specifications, and then printed.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, you can print two values in hex like this:
	</p>
	<pre><code>printf "foo, bar-foo = 0x%x, 0x%x\n", foo, bar-foo	</code></pre>
	<p>
		printf supports all the standard C conversion specifications, including the flags and modifiers between the &lsquo;%&rsquo; character and the conversion letter, with the following exceptions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The argument&ndash;ordering modifiers, such as &lsquo;2$&rsquo;, are not supported.</li>
		<li>The modifier &lsquo;*&rsquo; is not supported for specifying precision or width.</li>
		<li>The &lsquo;&#039;&rsquo; flag (for separation of digits into groups according to LC_NUMERIC&#039;) is not supported.</li>
		<li>The type modifiers &lsquo;hh&rsquo;, &lsquo;j&rsquo;, &lsquo;t&rsquo;, and &lsquo;z&rsquo; are not supported.</li>
		<li>The conversion letter &lsquo;n&rsquo; (as in &lsquo;%n&rsquo;) is not supported.</li>
		<li>The conversion letters &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;A&rsquo; are not supported.</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<p>
		Note that the &lsquo;ll&rsquo; type modifier is supported only if the underlying C implementation used to build GDB supports the long long int type, and the &lsquo;L&rsquo; type modifier is supported only if long double type is available.
	</p>
	<p>
		As in C, printf supports simple backslash&ndash;escape sequences, such as \n, &lsquo;\t&rsquo;, &lsquo;\\&rsquo;, &lsquo;\&quot;&rsquo;, &lsquo;\a&rsquo;, and &lsquo;\f&rsquo;, that consist of backslash followed by a single character. Octal and hexadecimal escape sequences are not supported.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, printf supports conversion specifications for DFP (Decimal Floating Point) types using the following length modifiers together with a floating point specifier. letters:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&lsquo;H&rsquo; for printing Decimal32 types.</li>
		<li>&lsquo;D&rsquo; for printing Decimal64 types.</li>
		<li>&lsquo;DD&rsquo; for printing Decimal128 types.</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<p>
		If the underlying C implementation used to build GDB has support for the three length modifiers for DFP types, other modifiers such as width and precision will also be available for GDB to use.
	</p>
	<p>
		In case there is no such C support, no additional modifiers will be available and the value will be printed in the standard way.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here&rsquo;s an example of printing DFP types using the above conversion letters:
	</p>
	<pre><code>printf "D32: %Hf - D64: %Df - D128: %DDf\n",1.2345df,1.2E10dd,1.2E1dl	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Additionally, printf supports a special &lsquo;%V&rsquo; output format. This format prints the string representation of an expression just as GDB would produce with the standard print command (see Examining Data):
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) print array
$1 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
(gdb) printf "Array is: %V\n", array
Array is: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		It is possible to include print options with the &lsquo;%V&rsquo; format by placing them in &lsquo;[...]&rsquo; immediately after the &lsquo;%V&rsquo;, like this:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) printf "Array is: %V[-array-indexes on]\n", array
Array is: {[0] = 0, [1] = 1, [2] = 2, [3] = 3, [4] = 4, [5] = 5}	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If you need to print a literal &lsquo;[&rsquo; directly after a &lsquo;%V&rsquo;, then just include an empty print options list:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) printf "Array is: %V[][Hello]\n", array
Array is: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}[Hello]	</code></pre>
	<li>eval template, expressions&hellip;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Convert the values of one or more expressions under the control of the string template to a command line, and call it.
	</p>
</ul>

</div>
<p>
	Aliases allow you to define alternate spellings for existing commands. For example, if a new GDB command defined in Python (see Python) has a long name, it is handy to have an abbreviated version of it that involves less typing.
</p>
<p>
	GDB itself uses aliases. For example &lsquo;s&rsquo; is an alias of the &lsquo;step&rsquo; command even though it is otherwise an ambiguous abbreviation of other commands like &lsquo;set&rsquo; and &lsquo;show&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
	Aliases are also used to provide shortened or more common versions of multi&ndash;word commands. For example, GDB provides the &lsquo;tty&rsquo; alias of the &lsquo;set inferior&ndash;tty&rsquo; command.
</p>
<p>
	You can define a new alias with the &lsquo;alias&rsquo; command.
</p>
<pre><code>alias [-a] [--] alias = command [default-args]</code></pre>
<p>
	alias specifies the name of the new alias. Each word of alias must consist of letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.
</p>
<p>
	command specifies the name of an existing command that is being aliased.
</p>
<p>
	command can also be the name of an existing alias. In this case, command cannot be an alias that has default arguments.
</p>
<p>
	The &lsquo;&ndash;a&rsquo; option specifies that the new alias is an abbreviation of the command. Abbreviations are not used in command completion.
</p>
<p>
	The &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; option specifies the end of options, and is useful when alias begins with a dash.
</p>
<p>
	You can specify default&ndash;args for your alias. These default&ndash;args will be automatically added before the alias arguments typed explicitly on the command line.
</p>
<p>
	For example, the below defines an alias btfullall that shows all local variables and all frame arguments:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias btfullall = backtrace -full -frame-arguments all</code></pre>
<p>
	For more information about default&ndash;args, see Default Arguments.
</p>
<p>
	Here is a simple example showing how to make an abbreviation of a command so that there is less to type. Suppose you were tired of typing &lsquo;disas&rsquo;, the current shortest unambiguous abbreviation of the &lsquo;disassemble&rsquo; command and you wanted an even shorter version named &lsquo;di&rsquo;. The following will accomplish this.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias -a di = disas</code></pre>
<p>
	Note that aliases are different from user&ndash;defined commands. With a user&ndash;defined command, you also need to write documentation for it with the &lsquo;document&rsquo; command. An alias automatically picks up the documentation of the existing command.
</p>
<p>
	Here is an example where we make &lsquo;elms&rsquo; an abbreviation of &lsquo;elements&rsquo; in the &lsquo;set print elements&rsquo; command. This is to show that you can make an abbreviation of any part of a command.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias -a set print elms = set print elements
(gdb) alias -a show print elms = show print elements
(gdb) set p elms 200
(gdb) show p elms
Limit on string chars or array elements to print is 200.</code></pre>
<p>
	Note that if you are defining an alias of a &lsquo;set&rsquo; command, and you want to have an alias for the corresponding &lsquo;show&rsquo; command, then you need to define the latter separately.
</p>
<p>
	Unambiguously abbreviated commands are allowed in command and alias, just as they are normally.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias -a set pr elms = set p ele</code></pre>
<p>
	Finally, here is an example showing the creation of a one word alias for a more complex command. This creates alias &lsquo;spe&rsquo; of the command &lsquo;set print elements&rsquo;.
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias spe = set print elements
(gdb) spe 20</code></pre>
<p>
	• Command aliases default args:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Default arguments for aliases
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_3ee7201f" href="#TOC_HEAD_3ee7201f">23.2.1 Default Arguments</a></H3>
<p>
	You can tell GDB to always prepend some default arguments to the list of arguments provided explicitly by the user when using a user&ndash;defined alias.
</p>
<p>
	If you repeatedly use the same arguments or options for a command, you can define an alias for this command and tell GDB to automatically prepend these arguments or options to the list of arguments you type explicitly when using the alias18.
</p>
<p>
	For example, if you often use the command thread apply all specifying to work on the threads in ascending order and to continue in case it encounters an error, you can tell GDB to automatically preprend the &ndash;ascending and &ndash;c options by using:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias thread apply asc-all = thread apply all -ascending -c</code></pre>
<p>
	Once you have defined this alias with its default args, any time you type the thread apply asc&ndash;all followed by some arguments, GDB will execute thread apply all &ndash;ascending &ndash;c some arguments.
</p>
<p>
	To have even less to type, you can also define a one word alias:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias t_a_c = thread apply all -ascending -c</code></pre>
<p>
	As usual, unambiguous abbreviations can be used for alias and default&ndash;args.
</p>
<p>
	The different aliases of a command do not share their default args. For example, you define a new alias bt_ALL showing all possible information and another alias bt_SMALL showing very limited information using:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias bt_ALL = backtrace -entry-values both -frame-arg all \
-past-main -past-entry -full
(gdb) alias bt_SMALL = backtrace -entry-values no -frame-arg none \
-past-main off -past-entry off

(For more on using the alias command, see Aliases.)</code></pre>
<p>
	Default args are not limited to the arguments and options of command, but can specify nested commands if command accepts such a nested command as argument. For example, the below defines faalocalsoftype that lists the frames having locals of a certain type, together with the matching local vars:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias faalocalsoftype = frame apply all info locals -q -t
(gdb) faalocalsoftype int
#1  0x55554f5e in sleeper_or_burner (v=0xdf50) at sleepers.c:86
i = 0
ret = 21845</code></pre>
<p>
	This is also very useful to define an alias for a set of nested with commands to have a particular combination of temporary settings. For example, the below defines the alias pp10 that pretty prints an expression argument, with a maximum of 10 elements if the expression is a string or an array:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) alias pp10 = with print pretty -- with print elements 10 -- print</code></pre>
<p>
	This defines the alias pp10 as being a sequence of 3 commands. The first part with print pretty &ndash;&ndash; temporarily activates the setting set print pretty, then launches the command that follows the separator &ndash;&ndash;. The command following the first part is also a with command that temporarily changes the setting set print elements to 10, then launches the command that follows the second separator &ndash;&ndash;. The third part print is the command the pp10 alias will launch, using the temporary values of the settings and the arguments explicitly given by the user. For more information about the with command usage, see Command Settings.
</p>
<p>
	By default, asking the help for an alias shows the documentation of the aliased command. When the alias is a set of nested commands, help of an alias shows the documentation of the first command. This help is not particularly useful for an alias such as pp10. For such an alias, it is useful to give a specific documentation using the document command (see document).

</div>
<p>
	You can extend GDB using the Python programming language. This feature is available only if GDB was configured using &ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;python.
</p>
<p>
	Python scripts used by GDB should be installed in data&ndash;directory/python, where data&ndash;directory is the data directory as determined at GDB startup (see Data Files). This directory, known as the python directory, is automatically added to the Python Search Path in order to allow the Python interpreter to locate all scripts installed at this location.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, GDB commands and convenience functions which are written in Python and are located in the data&ndash;directory/python/gdb/command or data&ndash;directory/python/gdb/function directories are automatically imported when GDB starts.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_4eb94335" href="#TOC_HEAD_4eb94335">23.3.1 Python Commands</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB provides two commands for accessing the Python interpreter, and one related setting:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>python&ndash;interactive [command]</li>
	<li>pi [command]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Without an argument, the python&ndash;interactive command can be used to start an interactive Python prompt. To return to GDB, type the EOF character (e.g., Ctrl&ndash;D on an empty prompt).
	</p>
	<p>
		Alternatively, a single&ndash;line Python command can be given as an argument and evaluated. If the command is an expression, the result will be printed; otherwise, nothing will be printed. For example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) python-interactive 2 + 3
5	</code></pre>
	<li>python [command]</li>
	<li>py [command]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The python command can be used to evaluate Python code.
	</p>
	<p>
		If given an argument, the python command will evaluate the argument as a Python command. For example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) python print 23
23	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If you do not provide an argument to python, it will act as a multi&ndash;line command, like define. In this case, the Python script is made up of subsequent command lines, given after the python command. This command list is terminated using a line containing end. For example:
	</p>
	<pre><code>(gdb) python
&gt;print 23
&gt;end
23	</code></pre>
	<li>set python print&ndash;stack</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		By default, GDB will print only the message component of a Python exception when an error occurs in a Python script. This can be controlled using set python print&ndash;stack: if full, then full Python stack printing is enabled; if none, then Python stack and message printing is disabled; if message, the default, only the message component of the error is printed.
	</p>
	<li>set python ignore&ndash;environment [on|off]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		By default this option is &lsquo;off&rsquo;, and, when GDB initializes its internal Python interpreter, the Python interpreter will check the environment for variables that will effect how it behaves, for example PYTHONHOME, and PYTHONPATH19.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this option is set to &lsquo;on&rsquo; before Python is initialized then Python will ignore all such environment variables. As Python is initialized early during GDB&rsquo;s startup process, then this option must be placed into the early initialization file (see Initialization Files) to have the desired effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		This option is equivalent to passing &ndash;E to the real python executable.
	</p>
	<li>set python dont&ndash;write&ndash;bytecode [auto|on|off]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When this option is &lsquo;off&rsquo;, then, once GDB has initialized the Python interpreter, the interpreter will byte&ndash;compile any Python modules that it imports and write the byte code to disk in .pyc files.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this option is set to &lsquo;on&rsquo; before Python is initialized then Python will no longer write the byte code to disk. As Python is initialized early during GDB&rsquo;s startup process, then this option must be placed into the early initialization file (see Initialization Files) to have the desired effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default this option is set to &lsquo;auto&rsquo;. In this mode, provided the python ignore&ndash;environment setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;, the environment variable PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE is examined to see if it should write out byte&ndash;code or not. PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE is considered to be off/disabled either when set to the empty string or when the environment variable doesn&rsquo;t exist. All other settings, including those which don&rsquo;t seem to make sense, indicate that it&rsquo;s on/enabled.
	</p>
	<p>
		This option is equivalent to passing &ndash;B to the real python executable.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	It is also possible to execute a Python script from the GDB interpreter:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>source script&ndash;name</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The script name must end with &lsquo;.py&rsquo; and GDB must be configured to recognize the script language based on filename extension using the script&ndash;extension setting. See Extending GDB.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The following commands are intended to help debug GDB itself:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set debug py&ndash;breakpoint on|off</li>
	<li>show debug py&ndash;breakpoint</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When &lsquo;on&rsquo;, GDB prints debug messages related to the Python breakpoint API. This is &lsquo;off&rsquo; by default.
	</p>
	<li>set debug py&ndash;unwind on|off</li>
	<li>show debug py&ndash;unwind</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When &lsquo;on&rsquo;, GDB prints debug messages related to the Python unwinder API. This is &lsquo;off&rsquo; by default.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_8d106aac" href="#TOC_HEAD_8d106aac">23.3.2 Python API</a></H3>
<p>
	You can get quick online help for GDB&rsquo;s Python API by issuing the command python help (gdb).
</p>
<p>
	Functions and methods which have two or more optional arguments allow them to be specified using keyword syntax. This allows passing some optional arguments while skipping others. Example: gdb.some_function (&#039;foo&#039;, bar = 1, baz = 2).

	<H1><a name="HEAD_e5b70b4c" href="#TOC_HEAD_e5b70b4c">24 Command Interpreters</a></H1>
<p>
	GDB supports multiple command interpreters, and some command infrastructure to allow users or user interface writers to switch between interpreters or run commands in other interpreters.
</p>
<p>
	GDB currently supports two command interpreters, the console interpreter (sometimes called the command&ndash;line interpreter or CLI) and the machine interface interpreter (or GDB/MI). This manual describes both of these interfaces in great detail.
</p>
<p>
	By default, GDB will start with the console interpreter. However, the user may choose to start GDB with another interpreter by specifying the &ndash;i or &ndash;&ndash;interpreter startup options. Defined interpreters include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>console</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The traditional console or command&ndash;line interpreter. This is the most often used interpreter with GDB. With no interpreter specified at runtime, GDB will use this interpreter.
	</p>
	<li>dap</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When GDB has been built with Python support, it also supports the Debugger Adapter Protocol. This protocol can be used by a debugger GUI or an IDE to communicate with GDB. This protocol is documented at https://microsoft.github.io/debug&ndash;adapter&ndash;protocol/. See Debugger Adapter Protocol, for information about GDB extensions to the protocol.
	</p>
	<li>mi</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The newest GDB/MI interface (currently mi3). Used primarily by programs wishing to use GDB as a backend for a debugger GUI or an IDE. For more information, see The GDB/MI Interface.
	</p>
	<li>mi3</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The GDB/MI interface introduced in GDB 9.1.
	</p>
	<li>mi2</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The GDB/MI interface introduced in GDB 6.0.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	You may execute commands in any interpreter from the current interpreter using the appropriate command. If you are running the console interpreter, simply use the interpreter&ndash;exec command:
</p>
<pre><code>interpreter-exec mi "-data-list-register-names"</code></pre>
<p>
	GDB/MI has a similar command, although it is only available in versions of GDB which support GDB/MI version 2 (or greater).
</p>
<p>
	Note that interpreter&ndash;exec only changes the interpreter for the duration of the specified command. It does not change the interpreter permanently.
</p>
<p>
	Although you may only choose a single interpreter at startup, it is possible to run an independent interpreter on a specified input/output device (usually a tty).
</p>
<p>
	For example, consider a debugger GUI or IDE that wants to provide a GDB console view. It may do so by embedding a terminal emulator widget in its GUI, starting GDB in the traditional command&ndash;line mode with stdin/stdout/stderr redirected to that terminal, and then creating an MI interpreter running on a specified input/output device. The console interpreter created by GDB at startup handles commands the user types in the terminal widget, while the GUI controls and synchronizes state with GDB using the separate MI interpreter.
</p>
<p>
	To start a new secondary user interface running MI, use the new&ndash;ui command:
</p>
<pre><code>new-ui interpreter tty</code></pre>
<p>
	The interpreter parameter specifies the interpreter to run. This accepts the same values as the interpreter&ndash;exec command. For example, &lsquo;console&rsquo;, &lsquo;mi&rsquo;, &lsquo;mi2&rsquo;, etc. The tty parameter specifies the name of the bidirectional file the interpreter uses for input/output, usually the name of a pseudoterminal slave on Unix systems. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) new-ui mi /dev/pts/9</code></pre>
<p>
	runs an MI interpreter on /dev/pts/9.

<p>
	The GDB Text User Interface (TUI) is a terminal interface which uses the curses library to show the source file, the assembly output, the program registers and GDB commands in separate text windows. The TUI mode is supported only on platforms where a suitable version of the curses library is available.
</p>
<p>
	The TUI mode is enabled by default when you invoke GDB as &lsquo;gdb &ndash;tui&rsquo;. You can also switch in and out of TUI mode while GDB runs by using various TUI commands and key bindings, such as tui enable or C&ndash;x C&ndash;a. See TUI Commands, and TUI Key Bindings.
</p>
	<H1><a name="HEAD_aef1297c" href="#TOC_HEAD_aef1297c">26 Using GDB under GNU Emacs</a></H1>
<p>
	A special interface allows you to use GNU Emacs to view (and edit) the source files for the program you are debugging with GDB.
</p>
<p>
	To use this interface, use the command M&ndash;x gdb in Emacs. Give the executable file you want to debug as an argument. This command starts GDB as a subprocess of Emacs, with input and output through a newly created Emacs buffer.
</p>
<p>
	Running GDB under Emacs can be just like running GDB normally except for two things:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>All &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; input and output goes through an Emacs buffer, called the GUD buffer.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This applies both to GDB commands and their output, and to the input and output done by the program you are debugging.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is useful because it means that you can copy the text of previous commands and input them again; you can even use parts of the output in this way.
	</p>
	<p>
		All the facilities of Emacs&rsquo; Shell mode are available for interacting with your program. In particular, you can send signals the usual way&mdash;for example, C&ndash;c C&ndash;c for an interrupt, C&ndash;c C&ndash;z for a stop.
	</p>
	<li>GDB displays source code through Emacs.</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Each time GDB displays a stack frame, Emacs automatically finds the source file for that frame and puts an arrow (&lsquo;=&gt;&rsquo;) at the left margin of the current line. Emacs uses a separate buffer for source display, and splits the screen to show both your GDB session and the source.
	</p>
	<p>
		Explicit GDB list or search commands still produce output as usual, but you probably have no reason to use them from Emacs.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	We call this text command mode. Emacs 22.1, and later, also uses a graphical mode, enabled by default, which provides further buffers that can control the execution and describe the state of your program. See GDB Graphical Interface in The GNU Emacs Manual.
</p>
<p>
	If you specify an absolute file name when prompted for the M&ndash;x gdb argument, then Emacs sets your current working directory to where your program resides. If you only specify the file name, then Emacs sets your current working directory to the directory associated with the previous buffer. In this case, GDB may find your program by searching your environment&rsquo;s PATH variable, but on some operating systems it might not find the source. So, although the GDB input and output session proceeds normally, the auxiliary buffer does not display the current source and line of execution.
</p>
<p>
	The initial working directory of GDB is printed on the top line of the GUD buffer and this serves as a default for the commands that specify files for GDB to operate on. See Commands to Specify Files.
</p>
<p>
	By default, M&ndash;x gdb calls the program called gdb. If you need to call GDB by a different name (for example, if you keep several configurations around, with different names) you can customize the Emacs variable gud&ndash;gdb&ndash;command&ndash;name to run the one you want.
</p>
<p>
	In the GUD buffer, you can use these special Emacs commands in addition to the standard Shell mode commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>C&ndash;h m</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Describe the features of Emacs&rsquo; GUD Mode.
	</p>
	<li>C&ndash;c C&ndash;s</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execute to another source line, like the GDB step command; also update the display window to show the current file and location.
	</p>
	<li>C&ndash;c C&ndash;n</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execute to next source line in this function, skipping all function calls, like the GDB next command. Then update the display window to show the current file and location.
	</p>
	<li>C&ndash;c C&ndash;i</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execute one instruction, like the GDB stepi command; update display window accordingly.
	</p>
	<li>C&ndash;c C&ndash;f</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Execute until exit from the selected stack frame, like the GDB finish command.
	</p>
	<li>C&ndash;c C&ndash;r</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Continue execution of your program, like the GDB continue command.
	</p>
	<li>C&ndash;c &lt;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Go up the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument (see Numeric Arguments in The GNU Emacs Manual), like the GDB up command.
	</p>
	<li>C&ndash;c &gt;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Go down the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument, like the GDB down command.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	In any source file, the Emacs command C&ndash;x SPC (gud&ndash;break) tells GDB to set a breakpoint on the source line point is on.
</p>
<p>
	In text command mode, if you type M&ndash;x speedbar, Emacs displays a separate frame which shows a backtrace when the GUD buffer is current. Move point to any frame in the stack and type RET to make it become the current frame and display the associated source in the source buffer. Alternatively, click Mouse&ndash;2 to make the selected frame become the current one. In graphical mode, the speedbar displays watch expressions.
</p>
<p>
	If you accidentally delete the source&ndash;display buffer, an easy way to get it back is to type the command f in the GDB buffer, to request a frame display; when you run under Emacs, this recreates the source buffer if necessary to show you the context of the current frame.
</p>
<p>
	The source files displayed in Emacs are in ordinary Emacs buffers which are visiting the source files in the usual way. You can edit the files with these buffers if you wish; but keep in mind that GDB communicates with Emacs in terms of line numbers. If you add or delete lines from the text, the line numbers that GDB knows cease to correspond properly with the code.
</p>
<p>
	A more detailed description of Emacs&rsquo; interaction with GDB is given in the Emacs manual (see Debuggers in The GNU Emacs Manual).

<p>
	Interaction of a GDB/MI frontend with GDB involves three parts&mdash;commands sent to GDB, responses to those commands and notifications. Each command results in exactly one response, indicating either successful completion of the command, or an error. For the commands that do not resume the target, the response contains the requested information. For the commands that resume the target, the response only indicates whether the target was successfully resumed. Notifications is the mechanism for reporting changes in the state of the target, or in GDB state, that cannot conveniently be associated with a command and reported as part of that command response.
</p>
<p>
	The important examples of notifications are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Exec notifications. These are used to report changes in target state&mdash;when a target is resumed, or stopped. It would not be feasible to include this information in response of resuming commands, because one resume commands can result in multiple events in different threads. Also, quite some time may pass before any event happens in the target, while a frontend needs to know whether the resuming command itself was successfully executed.</li>
	<li>Console output, and status notifications. Console output notifications are used to report output of CLI commands, as well as diagnostics for other commands. Status notifications are used to report the progress of a long&ndash;running operation. Naturally, including this information in command response would mean no output is produced until the command is finished, which is undesirable.</li>
	<li>General notifications. Commands may have various side effects on the GDB or target state beyond their official purpose. For example, a command may change the selected thread. Although such changes can be included in command response, using notification allows for more orthogonal frontend design.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s no guarantee that whenever an MI command reports an error, GDB or the target are in any specific state, and especially, the state is not reverted to the state before the MI command was processed. Therefore, whenever an MI command results in an error, we recommend that the frontend refreshes all the information shown in the user interface.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_af9f29" href="#TOC_HEAD_af9f29">27.1.1 Context management</a></H3>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_e8a68bf8" href="#TOC_HEAD_e8a68bf8">27.1.1.1 Threads and Frames</a></H4>
<p>
	In most cases when GDB accesses the target, this access is done in context of a specific thread and frame (see Frames). Often, even when accessing global data, the target requires that a thread be specified. The CLI interface maintains the selected thread and frame, and supplies them to target on each command. This is convenient, because a command line user would not want to specify that information explicitly on each command, and because user interacts with GDB via a single terminal, so no confusion is possible as to what thread and frame are the current ones.
</p>
<p>
	In the case of MI, the concept of selected thread and frame is less useful. First, a frontend can easily remember this information itself. Second, a graphical frontend can have more than one window, each one used for debugging a different thread, and the frontend might want to access additional threads for internal purposes. This increases the risk that by relying on implicitly selected thread, the frontend may be operating on a wrong one. Therefore, each MI command should explicitly specify which thread and frame to operate on. To make it possible, each MI command accepts the &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;thread&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;frame&rsquo; options, the value to each is GDB global identifier for thread and frame to operate on.
</p>
<p>
	Usually, each top&ndash;level window in a frontend allows the user to select a thread and a frame, and remembers the user selection for further operations. However, in some cases GDB may suggest that the current thread or frame be changed. For example, when stopping on a breakpoint it is reasonable to switch to the thread where breakpoint is hit. For another example, if the user issues the CLI &lsquo;thread&rsquo; or &lsquo;frame&rsquo; commands via the frontend, it is desirable to change the frontend&rsquo;s selection to the one specified by user. GDB communicates the suggestion to change current thread and frame using the &lsquo;=thread&ndash;selected&rsquo; notification.
</p>
<p>
	Note that historically, MI shares the selected thread with CLI, so frontends used the &ndash;thread&ndash;select to execute commands in the right context. However, getting this to work right is cumbersome. The simplest way is for frontend to emit &ndash;thread&ndash;select command before every command. This doubles the number of commands that need to be sent. The alternative approach is to suppress &ndash;thread&ndash;select if the selected thread in GDB is supposed to be identical to the thread the frontend wants to operate on. However, getting this optimization right can be tricky. In particular, if the frontend sends several commands to GDB, and one of the commands changes the selected thread, then the behaviour of subsequent commands will change. So, a frontend should either wait for response from such problematic commands, or explicitly add &ndash;thread&ndash;select for all subsequent commands. No frontend is known to do this exactly right, so it is suggested to just always pass the &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;thread&rsquo; and &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;frame&rsquo; options.
</p>
	<H4><a name="HEAD_909b96e9" href="#TOC_HEAD_909b96e9">27.1.1.2 Language</a></H4>
<p>
	The execution of several commands depends on which language is selected. By default, the current language (see show language) is used. But for commands known to be language&ndash;sensitive, it is recommended to use the &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;language&rsquo; option. This option takes one argument, which is the name of the language to use while executing the command. For instance:
</p>
<pre><code>-data-evaluate-expression --language c "sizeof (void*)"
^done,value="4"
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	The valid language names are the same names accepted by the &lsquo;set language&rsquo; command (see Manually), excluding &lsquo;auto&rsquo;, &lsquo;local&rsquo; or &lsquo;unknown&rsquo;.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_97ffaa77" href="#TOC_HEAD_97ffaa77">27.1.2 Asynchronous command execution and non&ndash;stop mode</a></H3><ul><a href="../tags/MI-async.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>MI-async</a>&nbsp;<a href="../tags/gdb-non-stop.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>gdb-non-stop</a>&nbsp;</ul>
<p>
	On some targets, GDB is capable of processing MI commands even while the target is running. This is called asynchronous command execution (see Background Execution). The frontend may specify a preference for asynchronous execution using the &ndash;gdb&ndash;set mi&ndash;async 1 command, which should be emitted before either running the executable or attaching to the target. After the frontend has started the executable or attached to the target, it can find if asynchronous execution is enabled using the &ndash;list&ndash;target&ndash;features command.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>&ndash;gdb&ndash;set mi&ndash;async [on|off]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Set whether MI is in asynchronous mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		When off, which is the default, MI execution commands (e.g., &ndash;exec&ndash;continue) are foreground commands, and GDB waits for the program to stop before processing further commands.
	</p>
	<p>
		When on, MI execution commands are background execution commands (e.g., &ndash;exec&ndash;continue becomes the equivalent of the c&amp; CLI command), and so GDB is capable of processing MI commands even while the target is running.
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;gdb&ndash;show mi&ndash;async</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show whether MI asynchronous mode is enabled.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	Note: In GDB version 7.7 and earlier, this option was called target&ndash;async instead of mi&ndash;async, and it had the effect of both putting MI in asynchronous mode and making CLI background commands possible. CLI background commands are now always possible &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; if the target supports them. The old spelling is kept as a deprecated alias for backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
	Even if GDB can accept a command while target is running, many commands that access the target do not work when the target is running. Therefore, asynchronous command execution is most useful when combined with non&ndash;stop mode (see Non&ndash;Stop Mode). Then, it is possible to examine the state of one thread, while other threads are running.
</p>
<p>
	When a given thread is running, MI commands that try to access the target in the context of that thread may not work, or may work only on some targets. In particular, commands that try to operate on thread&rsquo;s stack will not work, on any target. Commands that read memory, or modify breakpoints, may work or not work, depending on the target. Note that even commands that operate on global state, such as print, set, and breakpoint commands, still access the target in the context of a specific thread, so frontend should try to find a stopped thread and perform the operation on that thread (using the &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;thread&rsquo; option).
</p>
<p>
	Which commands will work in the context of a running thread is highly target dependent. However, the two commands &ndash;exec&ndash;interrupt, to stop a thread, and &ndash;thread&ndash;info, to find the state of a thread, will always work.

	GDB may be used to debug several processes at the same time. On some platforms, GDB may support debugging of several hardware systems, each one having several cores with several different processes running on each core. This section describes the MI mechanism to support such debugging scenarios.
</p>
<p>
	The key observation is that regardless of the structure of the target, MI can have a global list of threads, because most commands that accept the &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;thread&rsquo; option do not need to know what process that thread belongs to. Therefore, it is not necessary to introduce neither additional &lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;process&rsquo; option, nor an notion of the current process in the MI interface. The only strictly new feature that is required is the ability to find how the threads are grouped into processes.
</p>
<p>
	To allow the user to discover such grouping, and to support arbitrary hierarchy of machines/cores/processes, MI introduces the concept of a thread group. Thread group is a collection of threads and other thread groups. A thread group always has a string identifier, a type, and may have additional attributes specific to the type. A new command, &ndash;list&ndash;thread&ndash;groups, returns the list of top&ndash;level thread groups, which correspond to processes that GDB is debugging at the moment. By passing an identifier of a thread group to the &ndash;list&ndash;thread&ndash;groups command, it is possible to obtain the members of specific thread group.
</p>
<p>
	To allow the user to easily discover processes, and other objects, he wishes to debug, a concept of available thread group is introduced. Available thread group is an thread group that GDB is not debugging, but that can be attached to, using the &ndash;target&ndash;attach command. The list of available top&ndash;level thread groups can be obtained using &lsquo;&ndash;list&ndash;thread&ndash;groups &ndash;&ndash;available&rsquo;. In general, the content of a thread group may be only retrieved only after attaching to that thread group.
</p>
<p>
	Thread groups are related to inferiors (see Inferiors Connections and Programs). Each inferior corresponds to a thread group of a special type &lsquo;process&rsquo;, and some additional operations are permitted on such thread groups.

	<H2><a name="HEAD_482d11a" href="#TOC_HEAD_482d11a">27.3 GDB/MI Compatibility with CLI</a></H2>
<p>
	For the developers convenience CLI commands can be entered directly, but there may be some unexpected behaviour. For example, commands that query the user will behave as if the user replied yes, breakpoint command lists are not executed and some CLI commands, such as if, when and define, prompt for further input with &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;, which is not valid MI output.
</p>
<p>
	This feature may be removed at some stage in the future and it is recommended that front ends use the &ndash;interpreter&ndash;exec command (see &ndash;interpreter&ndash;exec).
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_6a2e1dc2" href="#TOC_HEAD_6a2e1dc2">27.4 GDB/MI Development and Front Ends</a></H2>
<p>
	The application which takes the MI output and presents the state of the program being debugged to the user is called a front end.
</p>
<p>
	Since GDB/MI is used by a variety of front ends to GDB, changes to the MI interface may break existing usage. This section describes how the protocol changes and how to request previous version of the protocol when it does.
</p>
<p>
	Some changes in MI need not break a carefully designed front end, and for these the MI version will remain unchanged. The following is a list of changes that may occur within one level, so front ends should parse MI output in a way that can handle them:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>New MI commands may be added.</li>
	<li>New fields may be added to the output of any MI command.</li>
	<li>The range of values for fields with specified values, e.g., in_scope (see &ndash;var&ndash;update) may be extended.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	If the changes are likely to break front ends, the MI version level will be increased by one. The new versions of the MI protocol are not compatible with the old versions. Old versions of MI remain available, allowing front ends to keep using them until they are modified to use the latest MI version.
</p>
<p>
	Since &ndash;&ndash;interpreter=mi always points to the latest MI version, it is recommended that front ends request a specific version of MI when launching GDB (e.g. &ndash;&ndash;interpreter=mi2) to make sure they get an interpreter with the MI version they expect.
</p>
<p>
	The following table gives a summary of the released versions of the MI interface: the version number, the version of GDB in which it first appeared and the breaking changes compared to the previous version.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a name="GDB-USER-MANUAL-MI-VERSION-1">MI version table &nbsp;<a href="../tags/MI-version.html" target="_blank" id="inlntag"><i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw"></i>MI-version</a></li>

	</tr>
</table>
<br>
</ul>
<p>
	If your front end cannot yet migrate to a more recent version of the MI protocol, you can nevertheless selectively enable specific features available in those recent MI versions, using the following commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>&ndash;fix&ndash;multi&ndash;location&ndash;breakpoint&ndash;output</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use the output for multi&ndash;location breakpoints which was introduced by MI 3, even when using MI versions below 3. This command has no effect when using MI version 3 or later.
	</p>
	<li>&ndash;fix&ndash;breakpoint&ndash;script&ndash;output</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Use the output for the breakpoint &quot;script&quot; field which was introduced by MI 4, even when using MI versions below 4. This command has no effect when using MI version 4 or later.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	The best way to avoid unexpected changes in MI that might break your front end is to make your project known to GDB developers and follow development on gdb@sourceware.org and gdb&ndash;patches@sourceware.org.

<p>
	In addition to a number of out&ndash;of&ndash;band notifications, the response to a GDB/MI command includes one of the following result indications:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;&circ;done&quot; [ &quot;,&quot; results ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The synchronous operation was successful, results are the return values.
	</p>
	<li>&quot;&circ;running&quot;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		This result record is equivalent to &lsquo;&circ;done&rsquo;. Historically, it was output instead of &lsquo;&circ;done&rsquo; if the command has resumed the target. This behaviour is maintained for backward compatibility, but all frontends should treat &lsquo;&circ;done&rsquo; and &lsquo;&circ;running&rsquo; identically and rely on the &lsquo;*running&rsquo; output record to determine which threads are resumed.
	</p>
	<li>&quot;&circ;connected&quot;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB has connected to a remote target.
	</p>
	<li>&quot;&circ;error&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;msg=&quot; c&ndash;string [ &quot;,&quot; &quot;code=&quot; c&ndash;string ]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The operation failed. The msg=c&ndash;string variable contains the corresponding error message.
	</p>
	<p>
		If present, the code=c&ndash;string variable provides an error code on which consumers can rely on to detect the corresponding error condition. At present, only one error code is defined:
	</p>
	<p>
		&lsquo;&quot;undefined&ndash;command&quot;&rsquo;
	</p>
	<pre><code>Indicates that the command causing the error does not exist.	</code></pre>
	<li>&quot;&circ;exit&quot;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		GDB has terminated.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_60afd98c" href="#TOC_HEAD_60afd98c">27.5.2 GDB/MI Stream Records</a></H3>
<p>
	GDB internally maintains a number of output streams: the console, the target, and the log. The output intended for each of these streams is funneled through the GDB/MI interface using stream records.
</p>
<p>
	Each stream record begins with a unique prefix character which identifies its stream (see GDB/MI Output Syntax). In addition to the prefix, each stream record contains a string&ndash;output. This is either raw text (with an implicit new line) or a quoted C string (which does not contain an implicit newline).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;&tilde;&quot; string&ndash;output</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The console output stream contains text that should be displayed in the CLI console window. It contains the textual responses to CLI commands.
	</p>
	<li>&quot;@&quot; string&ndash;output</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The target output stream contains any textual output from the running target. This is only present when GDB&rsquo;s event loop is truly asynchronous, which is currently only the case for remote targets.
	</p>
	<li>&quot;&amp;&quot; string&ndash;output</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The log stream contains debugging messages being produced by GDB&rsquo;s internals.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_9b62f1d3" href="#TOC_HEAD_9b62f1d3">27.5.3 GDB/MI Async Records</a></H3>
<p>
	Async records are used to notify the GDB/MI client of additional changes that have occurred. Those changes can either be a consequence of GDB/MI commands (e.g., a breakpoint modified) or a result of target activity (e.g., target stopped).
</p>
<p>
	The following is the list of possible async records:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>*running,thread&ndash;id=&quot;thread&quot;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The target is now running. The thread field can be the global thread ID of the thread that is now running, and it can be &lsquo;all&rsquo; if all threads are running. The frontend should assume that no interaction with a running thread is possible after this notification is produced. The frontend should not assume that this notification is output only once for any command. GDB may emit this notification several times, either for different threads, because it cannot resume all threads together, or even for a single thread, if the thread must be stepped though some code before letting it run freely.
	</p>
	<li>*stopped,reason=&quot;reason&quot;,thread&ndash;id=&quot;id&quot;,stopped&ndash;threads=&quot;stopped&quot;,core=&quot;core&quot;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The target has stopped. The reason field can have one of the following values:
	</p>
	<p>
		breakpoint&ndash;hit
	</p>
	<pre><code>A breakpoint was reached.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		watchpoint&ndash;trigger
	</p>
	<pre><code>A watchpoint was triggered.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		read&ndash;watchpoint&ndash;trigger
	</p>
	<pre><code>A read watchpoint was triggered.	</code></pre>
	<p>

	</p>
	<pre><code>An access watchpoint was triggered.	</code></pre>

	</p>
	<pre><code>The inferior has stopped due to a library being loaded or unloaded. This can happen when stop-on-solib-events (see Files) is set or when a catch load or catch unload catchpoint is in use (see Set Catchpoints).	</code></pre>
	<p>

	</p>
	<pre><code>The inferior has forked. This is reported when catch fork (see Set Catchpoints) has been used.	</code></pre>
	<p>

	<pre><code>The inferior has vforked. This is reported in when catch vfork (see Set Catchpoints) has been used.	</code></pre>
	<p>

	</p>
	<pre><code>The inferior entered a system call. This is reported when catch syscall (see Set Catchpoints) has been used.	</code></pre>

	<p>
		no&ndash;history
	</p>
	<pre><code>There isn’t enough history recorded to continue reverse execution.	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The id field identifies the global thread ID of the thread that directly caused the stop – for example by hitting a breakpoint. Depending on whether all&ndash;stop mode is in effect (see All&ndash;Stop Mode), GDB may either stop all threads, or only the thread that directly triggered the stop. If all threads are stopped, the stopped field will have the value of &quot;all&quot;. Otherwise, the value of the stopped field will be a list of thread identifiers. Presently, this list will always include a single thread, but frontend should be prepared to see several threads in the list. The core field reports the processor core on which the stop event has happened. This field may be absent if such information is not available.
	</p>
	<li>=thread&ndash;group&ndash;added,id=&quot;id&quot;</li>
	<li>=thread&ndash;group&ndash;removed,id=&quot;id&quot;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		A thread group was either added or removed. The id field contains the GDB identifier of the thread group. When a thread group is added, it generally might not be associated with a running process. When a thread group is removed, its id becomes invalid and cannot be used in any way.
	</p>
	<li>=thread&ndash;group&ndash;started,id=&quot;id&quot;,pid=&quot;pid&quot;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		A thread group became associated with a running program, either because the program was just started or the thread group was attached to a program. The id field contains the GDB identifier of the thread group. The pid field contains process identifier, specific to the operating system.
	</p>
	<li>=thread&ndash;group&ndash;exited,id=&quot;id&quot;[,exit&ndash;code=&quot;code&quot;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		A thread group is no longer associated with a running program, either because the program has exited, or because it was detached from. The id field contains the GDB identifier of the thread group. The code field is the exit code of the inferior; it exists only when the inferior exited with some code.
	</p>
	<li>=thread&ndash;created,id=&quot;id&quot;,group&ndash;id=&quot;gid&quot;</li>
	<li>=thread&ndash;exited,id=&quot;id&quot;,group&ndash;id=&quot;gid&quot;</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		A thread either was created, or has exited. The id field contains the global GDB identifier of the thread. The gid field identifies the thread group this thread belongs to.
	</p>
	<li>=thread&ndash;selected,id=&quot;id&quot;[,frame=&quot;frame&quot;]</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Informs that the selected thread or frame were changed. This notification is not emitted as result of the &ndash;thread&ndash;select or &ndash;stack&ndash;select&ndash;frame commands, but is emitted whenever an MI command that is not documented to change the selected thread and frame actually changes them. In particular, invoking, directly or indirectly (via user&ndash;defined command), the CLI thread or frame commands, will generate this notification. Changing the thread or frame from another user interface (see Interpreters) will also generate this notification.
	</p>
	<p>
		The frame field is only present if the newly selected thread is stopped. See GDB/MI Frame Information for the format of its value.

	<p>
		We suggest that in response to this notification, front ends highlight the selected thread and cause subsequent commands to apply to that thread.
	</p>
	<li>=library&ndash;loaded,...</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Reports that a new library file was loaded by the program. This notification has 5 fields&mdash;id, target&ndash;name, host&ndash;name, symbols&ndash;loaded and ranges. The id field is an opaque identifier of the library. For remote debugging case, target&ndash;name and host&ndash;name fields give the name of the library file on the target, and on the host respectively. For native debugging, both those fields have the same value. The symbols&ndash;loaded field is emitted only for backward compatibility and should not be relied on to convey any useful information. The thread&ndash;group field, if present, specifies the id of the thread group in whose context the library was loaded. If the field is absent, it means the library was loaded in the context of all present thread groups. The ranges field specifies the ranges of addresses belonging to this library.
	</p>
	<li>=library&ndash;unloaded,...</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Reports that a library was unloaded by the program. This notification has 3 fields&mdash;id, target&ndash;name and host&ndash;name with the same meaning as for the =library&ndash;loaded notification. The thread&ndash;group field, if present, specifies the id of the thread group in whose context the library was unloaded. If the field is absent, it means the library was unloaded in the context of all present thread groups.

	<p>
		There are three possible values, with the following meanings:
	</p>
	<pre><code>y

	This subsection presents several simple examples of interaction using the GDB/MI interface. In these examples, &lsquo;&ndash;&gt;&rsquo; means that the following line is passed to GDB/MI as input, while &lsquo;&lt;&ndash;&rsquo; means the output received from GDB/MI.
</p>
<p>
	Note the line breaks shown in the examples are here only for readability, they don&rsquo;t appear in the real output.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Setting a Breakpoint</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Setting a breakpoint generates synchronous output which contains detailed information of the breakpoint.
</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; -break-insert main
&lt;- ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
    enabled="y",addr="0x08048564",func="main",file="myprog.c",

    times="0"}
&lt;- (gdb)</code></pre>
<p>
	<strong>Program Execution</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Program execution generates asynchronous records and MI gives the reason that execution stopped.
</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; -exec-run
&lt;- ^running
&lt;- (gdb)
&lt;- *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",thread-id="0",

<p>
	<strong>Quitting GDB</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Quitting GDB just prints the result class &lsquo;&circ;exit&rsquo;.
</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; (gdb)
&lt;- -gdb-exit
&lt;- ^exit</code></pre>
<p>
	Please note that &lsquo;&circ;exit&rsquo; is printed immediately, but it might take some time for GDB to actually exit. During that time, GDB performs necessary cleanups, including killing programs being debugged or disconnecting from debug hardware, so the frontend should wait till GDB exits and should only forcibly kill GDB if it fails to exit in reasonable time.
</p>
<p>

	<H1><a name="HEAD_c4b9f88f" href="#TOC_HEAD_c4b9f88f">28 GDB Annotations</a></H1>
<p>
	This chapter describes annotations in GDB. Annotations were designed to interface GDB to graphical user interfaces or other similar programs which want to interact with GDB at a relatively high level.
</p>
<p>
	The annotation mechanism has largely been superseded by GDB/MI (see GDB/MI).
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_1127be4e" href="#TOC_HEAD_1127be4e">28.1 What is an Annotation?</a></H2>
<p>
	Annotations start with a newline character, two &lsquo;control&ndash;z&rsquo; characters, and the name of the annotation. If there is no additional information associated with this annotation, the name of the annotation is followed immediately by a newline. If there is additional information, the name of the annotation is followed by a space, the additional information, and a newline. The additional information cannot contain newline characters.
</p>
<p>
	Any output not beginning with a newline and two &lsquo;control&ndash;z&rsquo; characters denotes literal output from GDB. Currently there is no need for GDB to output a newline followed by two &lsquo;control&ndash;z&rsquo; characters, but if there was such a need, the annotations could be extended with an &lsquo;escape&rsquo; annotation which means those three characters as output.
</p>
<p>
	The annotation level, which is specified using the &ndash;&ndash;annotate command line option (see Mode Options), controls how much information GDB prints together with its prompt, values of expressions, source lines, and other types of output. Level 0 is for no annotations, level 1 is for use when GDB is run as a subprocess of GNU Emacs, level 3 is the maximum annotation suitable for programs that control GDB, and level 2 annotations have been made obsolete (see Limitations of the Annotation Interface in GDB&rsquo;s Obsolete Annotations).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set annotate level</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		The GDB command set annotate sets the level of annotations to the specified level.
	</p>
	<li>show annotate</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Show the current annotation level.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	This chapter describes level 3 annotations.
</p>
<p>
	A simple example of starting up GDB with annotations is:
</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb --annotate=3

^Z^Zpre-prompt
(gdb)
^Z^Zprompt
quit

^Z^Zpost-prompt
$</code></pre>
<p>
	Here &lsquo;quit&rsquo; is input to GDB; the rest is output from GDB. The three lines beginning &lsquo;&circ;Z&circ;Z&rsquo; (where &lsquo;&circ;Z&rsquo; denotes a &lsquo;control&ndash;z&rsquo; character) are annotations; the rest is output from GDB.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_60bf086a" href="#TOC_HEAD_60bf086a">28.2 The Server Prefix</a></H2>
<p>
	If you prefix a command with &lsquo;server &rsquo; then it will not affect the command history, nor will it affect GDB&rsquo;s notion of which command to repeat if RET is pressed on a line by itself. This means that commands can be run behind a user&rsquo;s back by a front&ndash;end in a transparent manner.
</p>
<p>
	The server prefix does not affect the recording of values into the value history; to print a value without recording it into the value history, use the output command instead of the print command.
</p>
<p>
	Using this prefix also disables confirmation requests (see confirmation requests).
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_8cdd751c" href="#TOC_HEAD_8cdd751c">28.3 Annotation for GDB Input</a></H2>
<p>
	When GDB prompts for input, it annotates this fact so it is possible to know when to send output, when the output from a given command is over, etc.
</p>
<p>
	Different kinds of input each have a different input type. Each input type has three annotations: a pre&ndash; annotation, which denotes the beginning of any prompt which is being output, a plain annotation, which denotes the end of the prompt, and then a post&ndash; annotation which denotes the end of any echo which may (or may not) be associated with the input. For example, the prompt input type features the following annotations:
</p>
<pre><code>^Z^Zpre-prompt
^Z^Zprompt
^Z^Zpost-prompt</code></pre>
<p>
	The input types are
</p>
<ul>
	<li>prompt</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When GDB is prompting for a command (the main GDB prompt).
	</p>
	<li>commands</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When GDB prompts for a set of commands, like in the commands command. The annotations are repeated for each command which is input.
	</p>
	<li>overload&ndash;choice</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When GDB wants the user to select between various overloaded functions.
	</p>
	<li>query</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		When GDB wants the user to confirm a potentially dangerous operation.

<p>
	This chapter documents GDB&rsquo;s just&ndash;in&ndash;time (JIT) compilation interface. A JIT compiler is a program or library that generates native executable code at runtime and executes it, usually in order to achieve good performance while maintaining platform independence.
</p>
<p>
	Programs that use JIT compilation are normally difficult to debug because portions of their code are generated at runtime, instead of being loaded from object files, which is where GDB normally finds the program&rsquo;s symbols and debug information. In order to debug programs that use JIT compilation, GDB has an interface that allows the program to register in&ndash;memory symbol files with GDB at runtime.
</p>
<p>
	If you are using GDB to debug a program that uses this interface, then it should work transparently so long as you have not stripped the binary. If you are developing a JIT compiler, then the interface is documented in the rest of this chapter. At this time, the only known client of this interface is the LLVM JIT.
</p>
<p>
	Broadly speaking, the JIT interface mirrors the dynamic loader interface. The JIT compiler communicates with GDB by writing data into a global variable and calling a function at a well&ndash;known symbol. When GDB attaches, it reads a linked list of symbol files from the global variable to find existing code, and puts a breakpoint in the function so that it can find out about additional code.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_c11ba8e4" href="#TOC_HEAD_c11ba8e4">30.1 JIT Declarations</a></H2>
<p>
	These are the relevant struct declarations that a C program should include to implement the interface:
</p>
<pre><code>typedef enum
{
JIT_NOACTION = 0,
JIT_REGISTER_FN,
JIT_UNREGISTER_FN
} jit_actions_t;

struct jit_code_entry
{
struct jit_code_entry *next_entry;
struct jit_code_entry *prev_entry;
const char *symfile_addr;
uint64_t symfile_size;
};

struct jit_descriptor
{
uint32_t version;
/* This type should be jit_actions_t, but we use uint32_t
    to be explicit about the bitwidth.  */
uint32_t action_flag;
struct jit_code_entry *relevant_entry;
struct jit_code_entry *first_entry;
};

/* GDB puts a breakpoint in this function.  */
void __attribute__((noinline)) __jit_debug_register_code() { };

/* Make sure to specify the version statically, because the
debugger may check the version before we can set it.  */
struct jit_descriptor __jit_debug_descriptor = { 1, 0, 0, 0 };</code></pre>
<p>
	If the JIT is multi&ndash;threaded, then it is important that the JIT synchronize any modifications to this global data properly, which can easily be done by putting a global mutex around modifications to these structures.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_233cccad" href="#TOC_HEAD_233cccad">30.2 Registering Code</a></H2>
<p>
	To register code with GDB, the JIT should follow this protocol:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Generate an object file in memory with symbols and other desired debug information. The file must include the virtual addresses of the sections.</li>
	<li>Create a code entry for the file, which gives the start and size of the symbol file.</li>
	<li>Add it to the linked list in the JIT descriptor.</li>
	<li>Point the relevant_entry field of the descriptor at the entry.</li>
	<li>Set action_flag to JIT_REGISTER and call __jit_debug_register_code.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	When GDB is attached and the breakpoint fires, GDB uses the relevant_entry pointer so it doesn&rsquo;t have to walk the list looking for new code. However, the linked list must still be maintained in order to allow GDB to attach to a running process and still find the symbol files.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_2b7fbe5" href="#TOC_HEAD_2b7fbe5">30.3 Unregistering Code</a></H2>
<p>
	If code is freed, then the JIT should use the following protocol:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Remove the code entry corresponding to the code from the linked list.</li>
	<li>Point the relevant_entry field of the descriptor at the code entry.</li>
	<li>Set action_flag to JIT_UNREGISTER and call __jit_debug_register_code.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	If the JIT frees or recompiles code without unregistering it, then GDB and the JIT will leak the memory used for the associated symbol files.

</div>
<p>
	Generating debug information in platform&ndash;native file formats (like ELF or COFF) may be an overkill for JIT compilers; especially if all the debug info is used for is displaying a meaningful backtrace. The issue can be resolved by having the JIT writers decide on a debug info format and also provide a reader that parses the debug info generated by the JIT compiler. This section gives a brief overview on writing such a parser. More specific details can be found in the source file gdb/jit&ndash;reader.in, which is also installed as a header at includedir/gdb/jit&ndash;reader.h for easy inclusion.
</p>
<p>
	The reader is implemented as a shared object (so this functionality is not available on platforms which don&rsquo;t allow loading shared objects at runtime). Two GDB commands, jit&ndash;reader&ndash;load and jit&ndash;reader&ndash;unload are provided, to be used to load and unload the readers from a preconfigured directory. Once loaded, the shared object is used the parse the debug information emitted by the JIT compiler.
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_f5e7a1ac" href="#TOC_HEAD_f5e7a1ac">30.4.1 Using JIT Debug Info Readers</a></H3>
<p>
	Readers can be loaded and unloaded using the jit&ndash;reader&ndash;load and jit&ndash;reader&ndash;unload commands.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>jit&ndash;reader&ndash;load reader</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Load the JIT reader named reader, which is a shared object specified as either an absolute or a relative file name. In the latter case, GDB will try to load the reader from a pre&ndash;configured directory, usually libdir/gdb/ on a UNIX system (here libdir is the system library directory, often /usr/local/lib).
	</p>
	<p>
		Only one reader can be active at a time; trying to load a second reader when one is already loaded will result in GDB reporting an error. A new JIT reader can be loaded by first unloading the current one using jit&ndash;reader&ndash;unload and then invoking jit&ndash;reader&ndash;load.
	</p>
	<li>jit&ndash;reader&ndash;unload</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Unload the currently loaded JIT reader.
	</p>
</ul>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_c83783b3" href="#TOC_HEAD_c83783b3">30.4.2 Writing JIT Debug Info Readers</a></H3>
<p>
	As mentioned, a reader is essentially a shared object conforming to a certain ABI. This ABI is described in jit&ndash;reader.h.
</p>
<p>
	jit&ndash;reader.h defines the structures, macros and functions required to write a reader. It is installed (along with GDB), in includedir/gdb where includedir is the system include directory.
</p>
<p>
	Readers need to be released under a GPL compatible license. A reader can be declared as released under such a license by placing the macro GDB_DECLARE_GPL_COMPATIBLE_READER in a source file.
</p>
<p>
	The entry point for readers is the symbol gdb_init_reader, which is expected to be a function with the prototype
</p>
<pre><code>extern struct gdb_reader_funcs *gdb_init_reader (void);</code></pre>
<p>
	struct gdb_reader_funcs contains a set of pointers to callback functions. These functions are executed to read the debug info generated by the JIT compiler (read), to unwind stack frames (unwind) and to create canonical frame IDs (get_frame_id). It also has a callback that is called when the reader is being unloaded (destroy). The struct looks like this
</p>
<pre><code>struct gdb_reader_funcs
{
/* Must be set to GDB_READER_INTERFACE_VERSION.  */
int reader_version;

/* For use by the reader.  */
void *priv_data;

gdb_read_debug_info *read;
gdb_unwind_frame *unwind;
gdb_get_frame_id *get_frame_id;
gdb_destroy_reader *destroy;
};</code></pre>
<p>
	The callbacks are provided with another set of callbacks by GDB to do their job. For read, these callbacks are passed in a struct gdb_symbol_callbacks and for unwind and get_frame_id, in a struct gdb_unwind_callbacks. struct gdb_symbol_callbacks has callbacks to create new object files and new symbol tables inside those object files. struct gdb_unwind_callbacks has callbacks to read registers off the current frame and to write out the values of the registers in the previous frame. Both have a callback (target_read) to read bytes off the target&rsquo;s address space.

<p>
	The traditional debugging model is conceptually low&ndash;speed, but works fine, because most bugs can be reproduced in debugging&ndash;mode execution. However, as multi&ndash;core or many&ndash;core processors are becoming mainstream, and multi&ndash;threaded programs become more and more popular, there should be more and more bugs that only manifest themselves at normal&ndash;mode execution, for example, thread races, because debugger&rsquo;s interference with the program&rsquo;s timing may conceal the bugs. On the other hand, in some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt the program&rsquo;s execution long enough for the developer to learn anything helpful about its behavior. If the program&rsquo;s correctness depends on its real&ndash;time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger might cause the program to fail, even when the code itself is correct. It is useful to be able to observe the program&rsquo;s behavior without interrupting it.
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, traditional debugging model is too intrusive to reproduce some bugs. In order to reduce the interference with the program, we can reduce the number of operations performed by debugger. The In&ndash;Process Agent, a shared library, is running within the same process with inferior, and is able to perform some debugging operations itself. As a result, debugger is only involved when necessary, and performance of debugging can be improved accordingly. Note that interference with program can be reduced but can&rsquo;t be removed completely, because the in&ndash;process agent will still stop or slow down the program.
</p>
<p>
	The in&ndash;process agent can interpret and execute Agent Expressions (see Agent Expressions) during performing debugging operations. The agent expressions can be used for different purposes, such as collecting data in tracepoints, and condition evaluation in breakpoints.
</p>
<p>
	You can control whether the in&ndash;process agent is used as an aid for debugging with the following commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>set agent on</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Causes the in&ndash;process agent to perform some operations on behalf of the debugger. Just which operations requested by the user will be done by the in&ndash;process agent depends on the its capabilities. For example, if you request to evaluate breakpoint conditions in the in&ndash;process agent, and the in&ndash;process agent has such capability as well, then breakpoint conditions will be evaluated in the in&ndash;process agent.
	</p>
	<li>set agent off</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Disables execution of debugging operations by the in&ndash;process agent. All of the operations will be performed by GDB.
	</p>
	<li>show agent</li>
	<br />
	<p>
		Display the current setting of execution of debugging operations by the in&ndash;process agent.

	The in&ndash;process agent is able to communicate with both GDB and GDBserver (see In&ndash;Process Agent). This section documents the protocol used for communications between GDB or GDBserver and the IPA. In general, GDB or GDBserver sends commands (see IPA Protocol Commands) and data to in&ndash;process agent, and then in&ndash;process agent replies back with the return result of the command, or some other information. The data sent to in&ndash;process agent is composed of primitive data types, such as 4&ndash;byte or 8&ndash;byte type, and composite types, which are called objects (see IPA Protocol Objects).
</p>
	<H3><a name="HEAD_9e79eb6e" href="#TOC_HEAD_9e79eb6e">31.1.1 IPA Protocol Objects</a></H3>
<p>
	The commands sent to and results received from agent may contain some complex data types called objects.
</p>
<p>
	The in&ndash;process agent is running on the same machine with GDB or GDBserver, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to handle as much differences between two ends as remote protocol (see Remote Protocol) tries to handle. However, there are still some differences of two ends in two processes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>word size. On some 64&ndash;bit machines, GDB or GDBserver can be compiled as a 64&ndash;bit executable, while in&ndash;process agent is a 32&ndash;bit one.</li>
	<li>ABI. Some machines may have multiple types of ABI, GDB or GDBserver is compiled with one, and in&ndash;process agent is compiled with the other one.</li>
	<br />
</ul>
<p>
	Here are the IPA Protocol Objects:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>agent expression object. It represents an agent expression (see Agent Expressions).</li>
	<li>tracepoint action object. It represents a tracepoint action (see Tracepoint Action Lists) to collect registers, memory, static trace data and to evaluate expression.</li>

	<H1><a name="HEAD_8719ec09" href="#TOC_HEAD_8719ec09">Appendix H Operating System Information</a></H1>
<p>
	Users of GDB often wish to obtain information about the state of the operating system running on the target&mdash;for example the list of processes, or the list of open files. This section describes the mechanism that makes it possible. This mechanism is similar to the target features mechanism (see Target Descriptions), but focuses on a different aspect of target.
</p>
<p>
	Operating system information is retrieved from the target via the remote protocol, using &lsquo;qXfer&rsquo; requests (see qXfer osdata read). The object name in the request should be &lsquo;osdata&rsquo;, and the annex identifies the data to be fetched.
</p>
	<H2><a name="HEAD_1f6869c4" href="#TOC_HEAD_1f6869c4">H.1 Process list</a></H2>
<p>
	When requesting the process list, the annex field in the &lsquo;qXfer&rsquo; request should be &lsquo;processes&rsquo;. The returned data is an XML document. The formal syntax of this document is defined in gdb/features/osdata.dtd.
</p>
<p>
	An example document is:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM "osdata.dtd"&gt;
&lt;osdata type="processes"&gt;
&lt;item&gt;
    &lt;column name="pid"&gt;1&lt;/column&gt;
    &lt;column name="user"&gt;root&lt;/column&gt;
    &lt;column name="command"&gt;/sbin/init&lt;/column&gt;
    &lt;column name="cores"&gt;1,2,3&lt;/column&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/osdata&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	Each item should include a column whose name is &lsquo;pid&rsquo;. The value of that column should identify the process on the target. The &lsquo;user&rsquo; and &lsquo;command&rsquo; columns are optional, and will be displayed by GDB. The &lsquo;cores&rsquo; column, if present, should contain a comma&ndash;separated list of cores that this process is running on. Target may provide additional columns, which GDB currently ignores.
